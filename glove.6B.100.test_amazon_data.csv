baby	"This book is such a life saver.  It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends, answer pediatrician questions, or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn.  I think it is one of those things that everyone should be required to have before they leave the hospital.  We went through all the pages of the newborn version, then moved to the infant version, and will finish up the second infant book (third total) right as our baby turns 1.

baby	"I bought this a few times for my older son and have bought it again for my newborn. This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine. When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work. Excellent for dads to keep track as my husband can quickly forget what time he fed our son.

baby	"I wanted to love this, but it was pretty expensive for only a few months worth of calendar pages.  I ended up buying a regular weekly planner - 55% OFF! - The Planner - that is 8 1/2 x 11 and has all seven days on the right page and the left page has room to write a To Do List and Goals.  I found this to be more helpful because I could mark each day's eating and sleeping blocks, then also see them side by side - I could see her patterns more easily with a weekly view.  This planner was cute, just not what I wanted."	1	-0.183774	0.246758	0.187045	-0.311903	0.022744	0.221818	0.012426	0.182172	-0.134293	-0.087028	0.300253	-0.060067	0.153212	0.042400	0.201995	-0.052855	0.062036	0.062215	-0.310120	0.176328	0.287288	0.097542	-0.024858	0.059913	0.172463	-0.156039	-0.073304	-0.341112	-0.043016	-0.105616	-0.075864	0.389963	0.023383	-0.076023	0.063515	0.254206	-0.108912	0.093230	-0.017113	-0.143471	-0.156088	-0.270396	0.184308	-0.299773	-0.102012	-0.108523	-0.107912	-0.310300	0.062593	-0.546761	0.176988	-0.179521	0.089019	0.809736	-0.156684	-2.018259	-0.120096	0.012801	1.350008	0.406946	-0.176806	0.693459	-0.272328	-0.134277	0.483694	0.047257	0.309467	0.203794	0.089959	-0.147342	-0.108043	-0.068500	-0.056648	-0.195606	0.052906	0.116295	-0.085254	0.049508	-0.532633	-0.056265	0.287516	0.036920	-0.352901	-0.059090	-0.984474	-0.283353	0.064529	-0.185663	-0.142491	-0.114595	-0.113612	0.082429	0.158892	-0.095792	-0.533453	-0.007454	-0.074126	-0.232649	0.389927	0.124834
baby	"The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available. You can track naps, feedings, diaper changes, activities, and notes. They're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker, which tracks nights and days. It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones. Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now. Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day. It's a great way for me to know what happened. Plus, it's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends."	1	-0.077060	0.204824	0.191824	-0.159810	-0.083428	0.152840	0.052829	0.233159	-0.129415	-0.168618	0.176677	-0.038313	0.204042	0.101793	0.200365	-0.053518	0.149385	0.089640	-0.123794	0.171424	0.111273	0.071645	-0.005325	-0.054345	0.109244	-0.024206	-0.235339	-0.331207	-0.055481	0.021103	-0.014222	0.247268	-0.008032	0.111003	0.059324	0.260894	-0.129758	0.149803	0.073847	-0.296868	-0.059495	-0.180414	-0.011937	-0.249037	-0.276246	-0.007523	-0.060059	-0.287959	0.081068	-0.579889	0.033397	-0.004951	0.111518	0.834007	0.020286	-1.777424	-0.052050	0.137403	1.177698	0.336780	-0.143297	0.717859	-0.183762	0.002477	0.607278	0.114401	0.244591	0.028196	0.194683	-0.237756	-0.086018	-0.146714	0.020019	-0.184251	0.088239	0.167730	0.032925	-0.077690	-0.485257	-0.178250	0.281377	-0.024719	-0.196019	0.088699	-1.062080	-0.099700	0.091909	-0.256864	-0.311569	-0.104864	-0.104890	0.033804	0.151748	-0.108894	-0.444538	-0.069393	-0.265607	-0.178359	0.354952	0.214295
baby	"During your postpartum stay at the hospital the nurses will ask you to keep a log of your baby's feedings, urination and bowel movements. However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk. For a while I wasn't sure what was giving him horrible gas, so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy (we have a peanut allergy in the family). We even write notes about his first smile, who came to visit, ect to keep in his memory box."	1	-0.046410	0.232970	0.099203	-0.122134	-0.236242	0.146352	-0.002910	0.216604	-0.010994	-0.228014	-0.000857	0.029041	0.137193	0.118021	0.189443	-0.119176	-0.009305	-0.018763	-0.112835	0.024251	0.032648	0.070838	-0.096869	0.067610	0.041340	0.188829	-0.227048	-0.429162	-0.014000	0.115201	0.041487	0.316711	0.035180	0.069592	-0.050052	0.232277	-0.054059	0.266813	0.034573	-0.162788	-0.211625	-0.180835	-0.065152	-0.479335	-0.065841	0.024029	-0.051298	-0.295160	0.010589	-0.641005	0.120419	-0.055713	0.105198	0.816834	-0.051886	-1.638803	-0.075892	-0.058350	1.151904	0.311635	0.019998	0.595746	-0.035399	0.004240	0.591095	0.131220	0.282693	-0.053035	0.145974	-0.228827	-0.077857	-0.111533	-0.007193	-0.063751	0.098218	0.230438	-0.103872	-0.084129	-0.557497	-0.108450	0.386599	0.005703	-0.377104	0.167766	-1.171291	-0.228963	0.181005	0.061997	-0.365368	-0.121583	0.064669	-0.054471	0.084981	-0.063963	-0.405854	-0.091551	-0.016125	-0.130108	0.330634	0.125962
baby	"I use this so that our babysitter (grandma) can keep track of what goes on during the day.  We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book."	1	-0.031256	0.228829	0.303762	-0.227314	-0.092322	0.242569	-0.055735	0.294811	-0.086073	-0.177472	0.187067	0.006984	0.134790	0.127387	0.088504	-0.136078	0.101121	0.103915	-0.318900	0.154306	0.197328	0.032288	0.007442	0.065127	0.150905	-0.087875	-0.163190	-0.401348	0.030799	-0.057511	-0.077070	0.328969	0.058475	0.068686	-0.030536	0.304841	-0.195372	0.159461	0.010733	-0.157032	-0.273061	-0.125586	0.142847	-0.345392	-0.163151	-0.062090	-0.014849	-0.267062	0.148023	-0.734505	0.145433	-0.119762	0.163970	0.880738	-0.140169	-2.006754	-0.093749	-0.027192	1.290674	0.453993	-0.080692	0.730917	-0.240070	-0.074327	0.630950	0.019765	0.279046	0.190746	0.035102	-0.179607	-0.050218	-0.172730	-0.045759	-0.205778	0.092807	0.248203	-0.117488	-0.024160	-0.634211	-0.104618	0.362138	-0.050972	-0.325616	0.004504	-1.225502	-0.171543	0.094638	-0.133513	-0.239562	-0.178396	-0.026902	-0.014081	0.066267	0.000723	-0.443320	0.030888	-0.098815	-0.109786	0.336548	0.180306

baby	"My wife and I have a six month old baby boy and around the 4-month mark my wife decided that she would return to work instead of being a stay-at-home mom. We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones. The legibility in the Baby Tracker is a huge improvement over our standard notebook entries that really ended up becoming small paragraphs. In a few short moments you can summarize all of the data in the columns in the totals section and determine key information - how much did baby eat, did baby have a bowel movement, how much sleep did they get, etc.There are, however, some frustrating limitations with this journal. First the entire layout is about half a notebook sheet divided down the middle (portrait layout). This constrains entries to very small spaces on each column and row. For much of the information that is okay - feedings can be summarized in ounces; diaper changes by a &#34;#1 or #2&#34; and so on. However, once your baby becomes more active and you'd like to know more than &#34;tummy time&#34; under the play-time column things start to get very tight on the page.Another problem is that this tracker only covers 12 hours out of a baby's day. That's fine if the intention is only to track hours while a baby is with child care providers. However, we really wanted to track our little boy's entire day which often starts much earlier than 6am. Using this journal that would require the use of a second page.--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(+) Good layout that is easy to read and instantly gather information about your baby's day in a matter of moments(+) High quality paper(+) Consistent quality between the pages--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(-) Expensive and gets you at most 6-months, less if you use more than one page for tracking your babies entire day(-) The cover is thick but not a hardback and bends easily in a diaper bag(-) The pages should really be bigger. I understand portability is a concern but the current size is entirely too small--------------------CONCLUSION:I ended up making my own format of this journal in a spreadsheet that includes a 24-hour day and more space for comments along with a few other changes and had the pages bound cheaply at a local shop. This is an adequate journal but expensive for what you get and limitations because of page size."	1	-0.182482	0.254504	0.241752	-0.133545	-0.067563	0.169868	0.010787	0.198421	-0.043355	-0.094967	0.205011	-0.029590	0.172035	0.021234	0.147496	-0.076149	0.109640	0.059623	-0.136387	0.114280	0.075546	0.033543	0.030211	0.026678	0.220208	-0.068856	-0.140283	-0.368062	-0.080349	0.076581	-0.027007	0.317095	-0.021266	-0.045701	0.020175	0.193633	-0.072542	0.152589	0.009974	-0.148665	-0.120853	-0.242984	-0.021398	-0.232503	-0.226809	-0.063123	-0.012857	-0.232034	0.067118	-0.528965	0.152075	-0.078063	0.092205	0.832980	-0.066197	-1.794221	-0.068866	-0.056262	1.304454	0.341725	-0.117049	0.630054	-0.198182	-0.027618	0.629439	0.037148	0.262133	0.114261	0.173732	-0.087328	-0.031356	-0.039757	-0.017945	-0.131984	0.139908	0.185881	-0.017443	0.012428	-0.550542	-0.145749	0.308663	-0.045561	-0.245610	0.015256	-1.089072	-0.158700	0.127959	-0.259480	-0.227880	-0.115819	-0.018072	0.103462	0.072101	-0.044295	-0.379504	-0.027558	-0.106403	-0.237164	0.421186	0.163612
baby	"I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction)."	1	-0.123323	0.231281	0.246309	-0.079315	-0.153093	0.254571	-0.047813	0.195225	-0.030249	-0.216148	0.206789	-0.038629	0.154407	0.028717	0.147947	-0.157003	-0.029572	0.111218	-0.278444	0.248538	0.202671	0.057349	0.034725	-0.032618	0.148919	-0.028941	-0.154814	-0.347903	0.089616	-0.082962	-0.086152	0.502888	0.024657	-0.016464	0.127671	0.238727	-0.235362	0.208887	0.093188	-0.160279	-0.169573	-0.191347	0.081365	-0.372079	-0.215555	-0.107819	0.092182	-0.232225	0.041503	-0.691384	0.040701	-0.086884	0.051506	0.861576	-0.128999	-1.846823	-0.012475	-0.019051	1.214864	0.332234	-0.112925	0.608886	-0.315992	-0.046040	0.521850	0.067910	0.347562	0.181543	0.078916	-0.137212	-0.048061	-0.154821	0.084282	-0.241203	0.148758	0.220835	-0.015225	-0.080922	-0.498979	-0.129669	0.337332	-0.088209	-0.464914	0.022787	-1.183015	-0.134377	0.132208	-0.013471	-0.286494	-0.159984	-0.044135	0.059509	0.148756	-0.059206	-0.458913	0.028475	-0.157994	-0.208630	0.356113	0.218429

baby	"This item was extremely helpful, especially with 3 adults sharing baby care responsibilities. My husband of mom didn't have to wake me up to ask when the baby had eaten or been changed.

Definitely a useful item to have."	1	-0.125192	0.308807	0.289897	-0.154466	-0.181956	0.129706	-0.160332	0.054602	0.033547	-0.192599	0.058746	0.011914	0.212396	0.097274	0.157521	-0.123881	0.012339	0.074717	-0.299572	0.316149	-0.002184	-0.020774	0.059578	-0.070025	-0.009662	0.011064	-0.236505	-0.488780	-0.039768	0.066465	0.118823	0.418947	0.083976	0.016241	0.013173	0.195520	-0.107096	0.074987	0.066923	-0.266873	-0.153007	-0.174242	0.054346	-0.417648	-0.287362	-0.034787	-0.047474	-0.083253	-0.004957	-0.818303	0.203086	-0.068317	0.092022	0.820522	-0.000917	-1.755081	-0.040594	-0.039435	1.185473	0.258734	-0.006258	0.727852	-0.198350	-0.120845	0.628605	0.085716	0.283874	0.164639	0.212960	-0.192582	-0.009495	-0.122997	-0.020698	-0.149361	0.125092	0.296452	-0.244249	-0.116099	-0.509066	-0.123404	0.321657	0.006166	-0.298667	-0.039876	-1.371289	-0.265883	0.181865	-0.099151	-0.488792	-0.233824	-0.058906	-0.029823	0.170443	-0.295682	-0.439768	-0.011933	-0.203294	-0.256832	0.308056	0.163491
baby	"I've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital.  We're on the third one now.  It's useful for when the doctor asks how often she's feeding and urinating, but even better for looking at and realizing, &#34;Oh, she hasn't slept in x number of hours.  She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.  I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern, then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day.  It helps a lot."	1	-0.032768	0.249377	0.224534	-0.141744	-0.201918	0.293142	0.022940	0.303254	-0.086789	-0.275020	0.145226	0.028791	0.253973	0.079685	0.197931	-0.277179	-0.069579	0.126285	-0.220376	0.125252	0.210707	0.175140	0.058369	-0.007729	0.176066	-0.018805	-0.231943	-0.441473	0.028374	0.052610	-0.050695	0.301218	0.059096	0.050939	0.045559	0.192305	-0.265064	0.146994	0.161949	-0.149414	-0.298123	-0.077531	0.153529	-0.311705	-0.223895	-0.031426	0.025392	-0.196370	0.109415	-0.663392	0.006030	-0.252157	0.105469	1.021084	-0.100871	-1.951339	-0.151586	0.015614	1.127375	0.485925	-0.094469	0.792804	-0.180248	0.033296	0.460748	0.208964	0.357073	0.042201	0.042938	-0.075507	-0.037440	-0.268308	-0.012537	-0.219983	0.121213	0.278137	-0.115358	-0.068222	-0.542033	-0.057675	0.394382	0.042261	-0.406965	0.087340	-1.241797	-0.279531	0.073786	-0.078918	-0.424339	-0.189367	0.051893	-0.099396	0.131605	-0.040573	-0.554279	0.016327	-0.086148	-0.050862	0.276615	0.188801
baby	"Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.

baby	I have used this book since my son was born.  It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.  I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old.	1	-0.098432	0.285029	0.237797	-0.117918	-0.207079	0.120860	-0.080940	0.129064	-0.081844	-0.187413	0.110922	0.037109	0.202545	0.014554	0.047900	-0.290935	0.145486	0.081174	-0.356134	0.334285	0.079189	0.151608	0.030503	-0.031705	0.137724	0.002561	-0.174664	-0.590392	0.165796	0.056888	-0.202056	0.471552	0.066685	-0.080806	0.019581	0.276636	-0.154973	0.160660	0.073186	-0.183015	-0.299546	-0.113630	0.106658	-0.461971	-0.241886	-0.105321	0.149993	-0.303908	0.053167	-0.825995	0.050498	-0.175424	0.135968	0.873291	-0.085170	-2.034274	-0.063925	-0.027323	1.309283	0.257856	0.003013	0.762762	-0.335741	-0.114105	0.696951	0.071682	0.314115	0.245189	0.045600	-0.155570	0.097130	-0.212639	-0.054361	-0.176439	0.109903	0.137913	-0.065747	-0.069087	-0.604626	-0.194490	0.426417	-0.028643	-0.324724	0.083853	-1.250974	-0.136748	-0.003422	-0.245468	-0.381564	-0.272678	-0.001322	-0.004653	0.216262	-0.080274	-0.595288	-0.004653	-0.173409	-0.361405	0.326220	0.181574

I went back to formally fill out his baby album since I would have forgotten so many of those valuable little tidbits of information & memories."	1	-0.132500	0.220616	0.207152	-0.216960	-0.080877	0.185535	-0.075784	0.168540	0.024738	-0.169279	0.168744	-0.020488	0.136282	0.204869	0.128321	-0.175414	0.133645	0.154794	-0.249642	0.130553	0.112958	-0.011849	0.058094	-0.003826	0.083348	-0.057708	-0.284962	-0.278714	0.176682	0.014462	0.040721	0.265356	-0.064193	0.128157	-0.036859	0.314432	-0.174692	0.071884	-0.029901	-0.328370	-0.255034	-0.110878	-0.004571	-0.359627	-0.218537	-0.001226	-0.053849	-0.173086	0.095380	-0.580198	0.049524	-0.027974	0.147064	0.849463	-0.066376	-1.591974	-0.048778	-0.001775	1.090320	0.312640	-0.121762	0.735766	-0.203010	-0.040922	0.599051	0.030184	0.366029	0.039968	0.135895	-0.264620	-0.069234	-0.156404	0.022343	-0.209727	0.031776	0.190497	-0.121912	-0.055065	-0.467358	-0.031428	0.367393	-0.066166	-0.251045	0.026603	-1.058561	-0.095595	0.119961	-0.136823	-0.266980	-0.116696	-0.020243	-0.007723	0.089392	-0.064887	-0.505909	-0.153363	-0.159253	-0.048794	0.253807	0.239611

Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms!

baby	"THis has been helpful in tracking the feedings, diaper changes, naps and other developmental things for our little one but I REALLY wish they had laid it out so that you could leave it open and have the left side be AM and the right PM.  The way the pages are set up you have to flip a page to see a full day (starts with PM on the left and A.M. on the right).  It's a nitpick but if they had just let the user fill in AM or PM then the pages would be identical and you could look at a full day at a glance (with your hands full, holding a baby).

baby	"I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day.

baby	"Please, please take this to the hospital with you- you'll thank me later. We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO &#34;out of it&#34; dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns.

baby	"While I love the app on my phone (Baby ESP) for my husband and I-- it's not realistic for someone filling in to download the app. Our parents, who frequently watch our baby, have yet to embrace the app world.So, we use this on days when we have help. It keeps track of everything the doctor will ask you. (How many poop diapers, how many pee diapers, how often are you feeding, how often is he sleeping, what's his schedule like). We usually end up entering the data when we get home so our app can tabulate everything for us in easy to read charts.I kind of like this too because it helps us to review what was going on during the day while we weren't at home."	1	-0.183752	0.275799	0.363182	-0.264751	-0.127295	0.298019	-0.175495	0.196522	0.116183	-0.145920	0.246717	-0.072036	0.209099	0.031729	0.220204	-0.128545	0.152169	0.223482	-0.224169	0.317663	0.037338	0.094166	0.132703	-0.014027	0.100233	0.133180	-0.205492	-0.477241	0.060846	-0.002545	-0.011050	0.491384	-0.012697	0.099224	0.159490	0.269922	-0.231755	0.104860	0.102305	-0.321696	-0.173180	-0.075648	-0.051665	-0.348405	-0.350802	-0.042860	-0.085438	-0.213217	0.099834	-0.628204	0.134667	-0.020175	0.168112	0.832804	-0.068464	-1.783500	-0.045482	0.057165	1.205796	0.313057	-0.053406	0.706914	-0.116452	-0.095605	0.565298	0.213564	0.394958	0.064904	0.090349	-0.230086	-0.003408	-0.108605	0.023050	-0.228513	0.123878	0.313486	-0.078688	-0.098829	-0.462657	-0.164922	0.418464	-0.107523	-0.400405	0.142628	-1.246234	-0.193277	0.047019	-0.145050	-0.350104	-0.183403	0.062999	0.089336	0.116899	-0.168192	-0.351592	-0.112336	-0.165709	-0.184729	0.457569	0.247757

baby	"This is probably one of the greatest inventions. Before my baby was born, I purchased this and figured it's a nice-to-have item.I didn't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple, but easily organized log book. When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months. (I bought a second one after the 3 months one was done.)I used it to keep track of diaper changes and what kind (pee/poop), naps, and how long my baby nursed on each side. I also wrote notes for each day so I could see a history of reactions/milestones. It made it easier to figure out what gave my baby gas or why she slept better on certain days.Coupled with the Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Timer (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you! One of the most useful items yet."	1	-0.093405	0.292413	0.280093	-0.167097	-0.139317	0.168390	-0.005441	0.166898	-0.014839	-0.168904	0.176443	0.021407	0.154026	0.069532	0.137229	-0.169485	0.104965	0.189569	-0.289461	0.185144	0.225525	0.077997	0.002003	-0.049670	0.167273	-0.047842	-0.277803	-0.445014	0.052708	-0.068313	-0.040785	0.394210	0.011230	0.033898	0.077650	0.212660	-0.181637	0.205672	0.034405	-0.205723	-0.196053	-0.090700	0.106066	-0.356019	-0.160964	-0.045225	0.126962	-0.248336	0.073438	-0.643003	0.006993	-0.078700	0.165126	0.888721	-0.088614	-1.887571	-0.059732	0.008405	1.185928	0.383715	-0.035990	0.741590	-0.260544	-0.003855	0.646191	0.054891	0.367372	0.102405	0.054929	-0.235851	-0.043091	-0.153906	0.055828	-0.184718	0.140429	0.211452	-0.107404	-0.125804	-0.586464	-0.055493	0.397507	0.011091	-0.349870	0.044066	-1.302357	-0.223471	0.079716	-0.184322	-0.272815	-0.236626	-0.051393	-0.068480	0.079053	-0.066001	-0.501229	-0.044450	-0.096387	-0.207080	0.323750	0.183484

Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).

You can keep track of anything your baby does, from eating and sleeping and diapering to all the other things they do like first smile and first laugh. I only wish that instead of being 3 months it would be longer, like 6 months or even 1 year. I would definitely recommend for the first months of your baby's life."	1	0.081059	0.311763	0.308828	-0.201076	-0.129861	0.152492	-0.023199	0.142307	0.003797	-0.197808	0.096335	0.125962	0.158210	0.126464	0.127468	-0.216743	0.041950	0.210580	-0.246115	0.265842	0.188166	0.102266	-0.085030	0.000446	0.204811	0.158017	-0.292674	-0.557051	0.097581	0.033355	-0.089116	0.390681	0.053996	-0.134868	0.032946	0.302161	-0.082820	0.138039	0.030479	-0.307377	-0.218422	-0.026920	0.089059	-0.381156	-0.253531	0.042828	0.098313	-0.295847	0.005678	-0.826289	0.066859	-0.173470	0.151416	0.924747	-0.151085	-2.063781	-0.050111	0.038277	1.238168	0.391076	-0.043500	0.814634	-0.261764	-0.064043	0.675399	0.128869	0.446270	0.217846	-0.007183	-0.210402	0.031606	-0.082315	-0.125607	-0.178115	-0.013906	0.330125	-0.155672	-0.170864	-0.572452	-0.091595	0.379102	-0.088241	-0.326157	0.193766	-1.261099	-0.280550	0.130805	-0.184071	-0.277681	-0.177445	0.053551	-0.081264	0.100999	-0.156984	-0.487668	-0.067882	-0.146977	-0.097775	0.311415	0.172010

The only thing that could be improved is for there to be 5 cars.  4 is just kind of a random number to teach a young child to count to.	1	-0.071967	0.399830	0.249106	-0.229269	-0.158921	0.372755	-0.099545	0.100203	-0.087144	-0.079673	-0.006277	-0.050246	0.205712	0.098265	0.209579	-0.211897	0.118304	0.326626	-0.381046	0.481677	0.238885	0.013378	0.202578	-0.134100	0.209603	-0.092191	-0.228075	-0.508585	0.105050	-0.051179	-0.044634	0.343187	0.130417	-0.010395	0.178249	0.122012	-0.159809	0.163198	0.056584	-0.227733	-0.224987	-0.141771	-0.213625	-0.391766	-0.294485	-0.058945	0.035154	-0.183957	-0.109820	-0.750666	-0.009534	-0.126242	-0.178238	0.939675	-0.001962	-1.960369	0.028107	0.047159	1.419994	0.325953	-0.084563	0.942338	-0.198697	0.088677	0.765000	0.129518	0.461379	0.183366	0.206213	-0.205860	0.041819	-0.353218	-0.068495	-0.180566	0.151571	0.206098	-0.027722	-0.018075	-0.362486	-0.072908	0.596762	0.084560	-0.423654	0.020087	-1.368563	-0.207223	0.108836	-0.344826	-0.385106	-0.260788	-0.131642	-0.061523	0.181091	-0.202194	-0.521139	-0.246420	-0.388016	-0.232054	0.480197	0.161383
baby	"Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest."	1	0.039405	0.322398	0.256907	-0.146198	-0.011874	0.157303	-0.153177	0.109064	0.089373	-0.050906	0.187134	-0.060093	0.096870	0.145556	0.148580	-0.187042	0.160880	0.379642	-0.233386	0.352541	0.378772	0.024432	0.113252	-0.104046	0.269304	-0.091279	-0.196672	-0.235103	0.058676	-0.105703	-0.001324	0.313670	-0.046511	-0.014824	0.109879	0.134048	0.001414	0.144690	0.103852	-0.140870	-0.035112	-0.178125	0.046666	-0.305372	-0.078924	0.007702	0.078105	-0.038078	0.013632	-0.497943	-0.112086	-0.085030	-0.079115	0.927103	-0.100497	-1.765541	-0.020939	0.112235	1.205577	0.308506	-0.094294	0.683173	-0.228060	0.273178	0.556211	0.025640	0.181305	0.144692	0.188628	-0.093999	-0.037907	-0.216068	0.000140	-0.220672	0.111551	0.251538	0.091892	-0.064067	-0.478623	-0.175545	0.406751	-0.027968	-0.271040	0.020002	-1.070794	-0.160860	-0.109268	-0.385093	-0.219173	-0.136787	-0.109255	-0.055186	-0.071057	-0.004784	-0.528268	-0.229987	-0.399577	-0.268383	0.579110	0.205873
baby	"These are such nice cars to teach little ones numbers and the stacking value.  Ours have been scooted across the floor, cat's tail, into walls, you name it and they've always come back for more.  It's just a nice change from the nesting blocks and it's fun to hear all the vehicle sounds that children make with these guys.

baby	"My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab.  The bright colourful colours really held her attention.  When she was sitting we played the &quot;Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down&quot; game and &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars.  They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething.  At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over.  She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game!  Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers.  Good value!"	1	-0.095477	0.289839	0.177234	-0.328479	-0.083015	0.259112	-0.094947	0.041466	-0.057655	-0.103354	0.124192	-0.037968	0.134923	0.179842	0.219355	-0.123753	0.080052	0.257901	-0.063093	0.176197	0.184010	0.076503	0.100338	-0.144199	0.326126	0.026690	-0.294417	-0.297760	0.024639	-0.078082	-0.013814	0.318093	0.162433	0.011666	0.148435	0.154268	-0.178071	0.158697	0.050607	-0.250975	-0.021933	-0.260669	0.048785	-0.336975	-0.105689	0.057034	0.013774	0.040920	-0.004653	-0.502805	-0.088388	-0.079737	0.059280	0.838872	-0.079975	-1.898413	-0.101444	0.078531	1.067590	0.189161	-0.025188	0.778477	-0.311631	0.208496	0.422178	0.042578	0.341803	0.051154	0.020095	-0.111639	-0.001790	-0.084841	0.014011	-0.214245	0.076997	0.248633	-0.152569	-0.097356	-0.280165	0.028749	0.395458	-0.109160	-0.275563	-0.042361	-1.031265	-0.315694	0.010524	-0.253453	-0.119625	-0.063552	-0.078716	-0.026892	0.058814	-0.017956	-0.458230	-0.180294	-0.343945	-0.128508	0.458974	0.173731
baby	"These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.

baby	"I bought this last month for my 6 month old son, and it continues to fascinate him.  It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!  He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too!

baby	We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!	1	-0.013037	0.254950	0.356384	-0.400548	-0.150996	0.165812	0.121225	0.179471	0.056210	0.009656	0.321947	0.092207	0.085744	0.213695	0.207044	-0.264189	0.332157	0.173136	-0.241955	0.332846	0.256910	0.163563	0.054670	0.009434	0.466575	0.089001	-0.375652	-0.373287	0.134754	0.000210	-0.003649	0.278074	0.301633	0.038655	0.191568	0.213106	-0.026670	0.167736	0.236128	-0.168630	0.007775	-0.188770	0.049765	-0.303720	-0.046602	0.108837	-0.162944	-0.108122	0.094750	-0.453639	-0.150508	-0.071258	0.121961	0.882152	-0.134209	-1.952679	-0.197484	0.287366	1.190175	0.276635	-0.163149	0.721579	-0.257909	0.169694	0.634076	0.051245	0.491397	0.271070	-0.052674	-0.027320	0.064103	-0.126847	-0.050851	-0.346975	0.243131	0.308699	-0.028822	-0.157043	-0.388621	-0.120480	0.463029	0.006316	-0.249152	-0.011209	-0.908704	-0.231306	0.002061	-0.380434	-0.089557	-0.156938	0.080998	0.009638	0.183449	-0.017186	-0.620109	-0.341614	-0.334176	-0.177713	0.393380	0.137551
baby	"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item."	1	-0.181308	0.280637	0.181645	-0.245451	0.054228	0.188089	-0.111724	0.135409	0.029813	-0.022390	0.189653	-0.060764	0.168174	0.093960	0.097540	-0.091921	0.128133	0.141711	-0.192168	0.156079	0.197848	0.062341	0.137831	-0.174529	0.229786	-0.047595	-0.275999	-0.262587	-0.044235	-0.001589	-0.055638	0.329858	-0.013001	-0.009505	0.171522	0.159182	-0.037334	0.039307	0.107219	-0.221112	-0.067787	-0.223506	0.058300	-0.317621	-0.134673	0.064397	-0.022301	-0.027542	-0.037303	-0.543209	-0.053858	-0.135480	0.003010	0.854192	0.006186	-1.762549	-0.068329	0.043238	1.168691	0.263077	-0.079366	0.768181	-0.107047	0.232870	0.547979	0.000483	0.363241	0.089786	0.101069	-0.187982	0.023670	-0.194046	0.061451	-0.211136	0.106132	0.209402	-0.074578	-0.072888	-0.327842	-0.066633	0.439063	0.042583	-0.269323	0.010359	-1.029101	-0.208481	0.010362	-0.269982	-0.222228	-0.182682	-0.016809	-0.014158	0.088018	-0.057133	-0.461652	-0.166918	-0.391147	-0.279172	0.575804	0.171552
baby	"I was looking for something different than your typical stacking cups for my sons birthday.  His aunt got him these.  What a hit! My son can't quite stack them himself, but he knows how to nest them and sure does love knocking them down when I stack them.  They also have the function of just being play cars, which is nice.  I am amazed at how long my son will play with these!"	1	-0.157271	0.209263	0.222002	-0.310037	-0.181246	0.332061	-0.063140	0.106400	-0.021005	-0.178585	0.256446	0.031369	0.119958	0.223471	0.121019	-0.228734	0.038332	0.343325	-0.258934	0.335378	0.115632	0.079579	0.065553	-0.177300	0.329594	0.026808	-0.383427	-0.384723	0.227614	0.050539	-0.010789	0.515679	0.178867	-0.020728	0.207866	0.185265	-0.062350	0.087426	0.058898	-0.269070	-0.044789	-0.123753	0.126211	-0.435575	-0.127603	-0.005478	-0.061493	-0.075863	-0.008248	-0.609477	-0.061690	-0.160347	0.196668	0.818354	-0.064080	-1.836681	-0.023822	0.177315	0.905737	0.350459	-0.093831	0.874973	-0.282184	-0.007376	0.550159	-0.001721	0.419428	0.163643	-0.016134	-0.131194	-0.006361	-0.097290	0.124671	-0.307713	0.209430	0.201703	-0.083386	-0.174087	-0.352465	0.028234	0.454926	-0.010399	-0.414311	-0.033962	-1.106597	-0.221281	-0.098165	-0.315584	-0.282629	-0.178347	-0.094782	0.001816	0.141231	-0.013073	-0.448107	-0.236373	-0.334143	-0.247791	0.243915	0.190849

baby	I think this is an adorable book. The pieces are all attached and each page has a cute activity. Several things though--1. If you sew you can make one that is more directed to your child. And if you sew you will realize this is very over priced.2. Some of the activities are too hard for the age group that would be playing with this book.	1	-0.151857	0.310611	0.067241	-0.223915	0.001279	0.241162	-0.057634	0.090227	0.002893	-0.007251	0.306455	-0.119242	0.136344	0.098637	0.130523	-0.014952	0.145848	0.182202	-0.196576	0.333724	0.222097	-0.035381	0.168966	-0.027433	0.184988	-0.030699	-0.170261	-0.425021	-0.059658	-0.018027	-0.147928	0.445607	0.005852	-0.186616	0.056943	0.174544	0.004038	0.140087	-0.045610	-0.245264	-0.118782	-0.104955	-0.022905	-0.287815	-0.231267	-0.105029	-0.057943	-0.145412	-0.001511	-0.502338	0.038477	-0.092519	0.072236	0.841526	-0.212626	-1.872754	-0.034283	-0.058377	1.167558	0.378764	-0.046688	0.876447	-0.294388	-0.036000	0.593194	-0.014756	0.376591	0.406647	0.196243	-0.152226	0.104109	-0.181378	-0.010393	-0.046233	0.056755	0.183653	-0.128144	-0.060043	-0.474704	-0.116220	0.215779	0.011687	-0.217967	0.082775	-1.201300	-0.280987	-0.010272	-0.208963	-0.191518	-0.141568	-0.228596	0.070555	0.101713	-0.139764	-0.386088	-0.154988	-0.310875	-0.323717	0.407968	0.152396

I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.

baby	"This book keeps my 2-year-old entertained for a decent amount of time, and I like that it's washable.  It has a good number/variety of activities in it, especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies, but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it.  My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off (they require a little extra &#34;elbow grease&#34; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page).  There are also some &#34;older&#34; activities, like the clock, or tying a shoe.Overall, good purchase."	1	-0.101996	0.314933	0.152702	-0.216639	-0.086915	0.116482	-0.092856	0.160012	-0.135552	0.020230	0.120684	-0.085149	0.207940	0.116038	0.190074	-0.090838	0.060136	0.136282	-0.168070	0.253579	0.138454	0.073816	0.153431	-0.025776	0.192524	-0.051995	-0.189765	-0.418301	-0.110255	-0.105249	-0.063510	0.364569	-0.055447	-0.049939	0.087565	0.206566	-0.095693	0.145598	-0.091813	-0.120681	-0.138127	-0.241901	0.034170	-0.262474	-0.202332	-0.135186	0.021946	-0.307664	0.003170	-0.678383	0.020385	-0.068168	0.021761	0.884764	-0.114742	-1.915206	0.037047	-0.097794	1.383607	0.303501	-0.118136	0.715020	-0.190688	0.061486	0.580311	0.017661	0.454269	0.128506	0.201664	-0.233843	-0.049124	-0.223313	0.027646	-0.064863	0.083309	0.204929	-0.113928	-0.055269	-0.583305	-0.031134	0.452720	-0.038834	-0.353190	0.128077	-1.212403	-0.136378	0.091237	-0.195293	-0.199466	-0.200546	-0.187455	-0.039730	0.046267	-0.155221	-0.533058	-0.141171	-0.186661	-0.264239	0.544727	0.169849
baby	"I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it's an item that he can grow into and it's super cute!"	1	0.016894	0.287062	0.235705	-0.355744	-0.028708	0.189621	-0.065163	0.034878	-0.050671	-0.140532	0.135697	-0.122150	0.157564	0.115668	0.106237	0.200677	0.074229	0.161706	-0.195614	0.217676	0.123962	0.001330	-0.077340	0.003966	0.360788	0.056721	-0.213006	-0.358546	0.006279	-0.178167	-0.081984	0.292860	0.018345	-0.154868	-0.028289	0.209085	-0.138180	0.052324	-0.015123	-0.265299	-0.028121	-0.136771	0.132262	-0.359658	-0.408405	0.071522	-0.002610	-0.036931	0.150701	-0.489578	0.039985	0.004229	0.105936	0.728920	0.017145	-1.568326	-0.024511	0.077215	1.042446	0.159449	-0.023989	0.807242	-0.199601	-0.075589	0.460372	0.044356	0.379565	0.064768	0.011431	-0.141626	0.090660	-0.028614	-0.040830	-0.095162	0.119125	0.317761	-0.167844	-0.086048	-0.363776	0.059602	0.215420	-0.053883	-0.133016	0.046471	-0.970585	-0.220601	-0.098521	-0.272425	-0.232618	-0.122339	-0.000281	0.138854	0.207893	-0.137507	-0.384779	-0.234177	-0.300121	-0.220036	0.395417	0.272956

baby	"I bought this book for my almost 2 year old daughter hoping it would be a nice activity on a plane trip. It is well constructed and attractive (though I must say not as nice as the quiet book my mother sewed for me as a toddler).The activities are:Page 1: Shape matching, different colored shapes match to same shaped outlines with velcro attachments. The velcro spots are a little small and flimsy.Page 2: Clock - the hands move freely, well constructed (my daughter isn't ready to learn the time but likes moving the arrows and talking about numbers)Page 3: Buttoning flowers to same colored buttons (this is too hard for my daughter to accomplish but I have her tell me where to button it by matching colors)Page 4: Tie the shoe - wish the string were a little longer which would make the task easierPage 5: Zip up the dress - my little one likes zippers - wish it had the ability to zip completely open so she could practice matching up the ends of the zipperPage 6: Buckle the pants buckle - this one is tricky!Page 7: Snap balloons on to color matched strings - the plastic snaps take a decent amount of pressure to apply and are a little hard to accomplishPage 8: 4 different texture and color swatchesOverall I think this book will last a long time and my daughter will be able to appreciate it more as she grows older."	1	-0.200021	0.287622	0.134703	-0.240865	-0.036049	0.228042	-0.135240	0.174913	-0.054977	-0.020856	0.092813	-0.031150	0.233877	0.091323	0.147894	0.010094	0.081523	0.127563	-0.070350	0.036598	0.087116	0.049768	0.062849	-0.076823	0.274798	-0.008455	-0.223565	-0.468002	0.040741	-0.246737	0.021799	0.344641	0.050111	-0.146705	0.141959	0.228353	-0.055156	0.060402	0.107095	-0.160510	-0.087985	-0.276175	0.107157	-0.282058	-0.357825	-0.024268	0.068406	-0.020212	0.069286	-0.604179	0.058365	-0.028541	0.138269	0.840804	-0.021948	-1.751826	-0.010719	0.004698	1.123712	0.235341	-0.108652	0.733546	-0.210127	0.068202	0.503258	-0.028604	0.342428	0.216510	0.007036	-0.206433	-0.004022	-0.093256	0.004248	-0.232062	0.171538	0.253498	-0.063648	-0.073739	-0.293839	-0.017788	0.252765	-0.086441	-0.311060	-0.017089	-0.974163	-0.195847	0.093825	-0.184247	-0.171669	-0.073547	-0.150054	0.059836	0.084935	-0.163646	-0.362795	-0.124864	-0.338191	-0.264168	0.279157	0.164818

baby	Great toy for teething! My daughter finds this very interesting especially when it gently vibrates and massages her gums. It didn't take her long to press down with her front teeth to activate the massaging action. She's enjoyed this just about everyday since we got it about 3 months ago. No issues with it! I sent one to a friend who just had her baby for when she starts teething.	1	-0.022985	0.277073	0.211026	-0.214256	-0.130848	0.187745	-0.084369	0.154780	0.108122	-0.222122	0.110792	0.010786	0.163102	0.279542	0.117784	-0.088253	-0.157353	0.043266	-0.152123	0.090419	0.174253	0.027537	-0.099687	0.036162	0.326830	0.223370	-0.312519	-0.316046	0.117561	-0.061306	-0.004359	0.252674	0.072713	0.053213	-0.035969	0.159155	-0.144619	0.028115	0.006078	-0.225834	-0.139238	-0.071366	0.107940	-0.396219	-0.219486	0.046592	-0.025088	-0.103366	0.115621	-0.426253	-0.053215	-0.060991	0.051078	0.823550	-0.060484	-1.640135	-0.102159	-0.037118	0.919860	0.318672	-0.003133	0.780611	-0.172244	0.054573	0.470775	0.016702	0.354684	0.065449	0.154934	-0.105216	0.049937	-0.050366	-0.014116	-0.177423	0.072054	0.240427	-0.218500	-0.046516	-0.489317	-0.030251	0.225286	-0.033331	-0.167854	0.157837	-0.942190	-0.243588	0.021741	-0.081173	-0.302020	-0.303749	0.071200	0.043465	-0.011900	-0.003165	-0.361250	-0.001336	-0.222255	-0.172248	0.305593	0.207807
baby	"I have a 6.5mo old who loves when we tap on toys when he has them in his mouth, yes sounds weird.  Husband is a drummer and got him obsessed with the tapping even when he is drinking out of his bottle my baby will try to tap the bottle with his hands to feel the vibration.  He has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face/mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he's a happy baby.  I also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when I brush my teeth.  He loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn't choke, you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking.This teether will be better if it had an on/ off button, my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on.  I was trying to find a teether with vibrations he can use by himself."	1	-0.046596	0.208595	0.226403	-0.274269	-0.117499	0.238774	-0.123243	0.108761	0.022232	-0.126233	0.041417	0.084853	0.082089	0.228169	0.170428	-0.057342	0.065712	0.179895	-0.089531	0.049171	0.170041	0.133091	0.024844	-0.178996	0.260874	0.296684	-0.372261	-0.363516	0.100138	0.009756	-0.018876	0.479375	0.063916	0.055338	0.112519	0.051656	-0.091020	0.046944	0.159968	-0.174578	-0.123393	-0.230840	0.005556	-0.468027	-0.299670	0.120052	-0.063511	-0.064091	-0.028707	-0.613060	-0.105404	0.013573	-0.028074	0.793359	-0.048516	-1.718583	-0.142238	0.021157	1.015852	0.233594	0.172477	0.695986	-0.244667	0.216208	0.478259	0.050602	0.490122	0.035391	-0.059397	-0.274369	0.042395	-0.103576	0.120718	-0.161453	0.076079	0.169211	-0.124738	-0.061985	-0.301764	0.022894	0.447979	-0.064209	-0.324103	0.085727	-1.013294	-0.248962	0.119017	-0.001684	-0.274090	-0.163097	-0.064663	-0.024453	0.016825	-0.154399	-0.385085	-0.132328	-0.294413	-0.198448	0.393289	0.023994

baby	"I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy."	1	-0.087564	0.283878	0.253502	-0.254374	-0.192345	0.091776	-0.169597	0.142638	0.075520	-0.119065	0.177204	0.068384	0.071907	0.043126	0.105587	-0.034448	0.007270	0.278396	-0.109662	0.239879	0.291296	0.212956	-0.011741	-0.186749	0.161233	0.039516	-0.335471	-0.380167	0.072119	-0.156627	-0.008114	0.341693	0.206140	0.028809	0.012728	0.184502	-0.198443	0.173675	0.108412	-0.117382	-0.147489	-0.151912	0.070932	-0.464291	-0.294696	0.059253	0.015165	-0.037281	0.163989	-0.576334	-0.143240	-0.030547	0.016207	0.792729	-0.058073	-1.723896	0.051820	0.039080	1.076256	0.279044	0.094459	0.845098	-0.329130	0.248593	0.420595	-0.019918	0.432219	0.142901	0.056954	-0.221854	0.120063	-0.266680	0.098398	-0.199057	0.099272	0.209971	-0.219666	-0.127522	-0.334020	0.067094	0.342043	-0.055450	-0.384263	0.023633	-1.164652	-0.216870	0.254575	-0.034405	-0.297548	-0.288245	-0.000346	-0.011039	-0.023317	-0.217650	-0.319552	-0.138897	-0.175259	-0.119589	0.341830	0.283804
baby	"I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. But overall I really like it."	1	-0.072628	0.287701	0.318358	-0.133733	-0.125544	-0.042293	-0.177399	0.105770	0.032288	-0.056444	-0.057098	-0.067190	0.166509	0.027283	0.077175	-0.166500	-0.031518	0.222238	-0.023454	0.244015	0.093784	-0.050793	0.000439	-0.066814	0.137657	0.088436	-0.134141	-0.437902	0.100064	-0.162531	-0.106980	0.468999	-0.006134	-0.174461	0.182976	0.124807	-0.042943	-0.003879	-0.053000	-0.254983	-0.136537	-0.259177	0.144190	-0.360442	-0.222097	0.035234	0.210378	-0.078401	-0.023764	-0.781087	0.019016	-0.068001	0.059256	0.849251	-0.011901	-1.989250	-0.050753	-0.088012	1.339727	0.215458	-0.050785	0.686890	-0.294842	0.097448	0.577243	0.033314	0.344748	0.114261	0.126494	-0.290173	0.182521	-0.230831	-0.019267	-0.161318	0.286885	0.209310	-0.225757	-0.185359	-0.422680	-0.031808	0.400267	-0.062544	-0.504838	0.134120	-1.120959	-0.166496	0.143042	-0.184870	-0.183131	-0.267744	0.020931	0.011138	-0.082183	-0.100401	-0.322727	-0.071812	-0.172132	-0.244685	0.389340	0.325508

toy	I keep this board on top of the hallway table so that I can quickly write notes (which won't get lost until I erase them) and it folds down neatly so it's easy to hide when company calls.  I also like the size -- not too big and not too small.  Quality magnets hold pretty good but I use it mainly for notes. NOTE:  Children's alphabet letters don't hold very well - they tend to slide.	2	-0.173852	0.406918	0.235615	-0.183919	0.042662	0.225866	-0.231473	0.065365	-0.104886	-0.131948	0.133130	-0.032059	0.176994	0.268456	0.015413	-0.002778	0.079078	0.117337	-0.111577	0.099138	0.106439	0.091346	0.079121	-0.054777	0.131709	-0.198827	-0.266191	-0.342689	-0.049864	-0.126815	0.125643	0.378080	-0.172255	-0.041062	0.035046	0.270530	0.057758	0.082669	0.019560	-0.227248	-0.096923	-0.345261	-0.098911	-0.379937	-0.163916	-0.031260	-0.053098	-0.064908	-0.023208	-0.661731	0.011112	-0.030526	0.102160	0.887255	-0.004164	-1.852498	-0.029339	-0.106523	1.334728	0.289353	-0.124348	0.676211	-0.200036	0.083119	0.582164	-0.094449	0.481090	0.330477	0.229772	-0.175043	-0.003799	-0.042011	0.060850	-0.282746	0.092128	0.190648	-0.159813	0.017556	-0.477306	-0.036136	0.381039	-0.109978	-0.505555	-0.135168	-1.140708	-0.258685	0.140848	-0.175339	-0.169936	-0.046526	-0.161284	0.058888	-0.003051	-0.161620	-0.411214	-0.092419	-0.239947	-0.280905	0.441694	0.226354

This is a big hit in my home and will grow with children as they become more creative...great learning tool too.  I also bought a container of magnetic foam objects so we can work with his spelling as he has now mastered his letters and numbers.

toy	"The board had to be put away for my 18 month old grand daughter and we used just the refrigerator for the alphabet intending to bring back the board when she got a little older. The wooden letters are not painted, but rather covered with a colored paper which becomes loose rather easily. Most of the letters lasted for about 2 months before I had to throw them all out.

You can spell words, put the Leap Frog base on it to put in letters/animals, numbers, etc.  It is also double sided.  Even though it's not intended they also like to put things under/inside the board.  They can roll things through it.

toy	"Working with Mandala type coloring books can teach us a lot. 1) the light/dark placement of colors to bring into focus the center of the mandala (an example is on the cover of the book). 2) learning color choices that work together, teaching us the basics of the standard color wheel. 3) to stay concentrated to a task is good for improving or retaining cognitive capacities. 4) becomes a relaxing process, 5) last and certainly not least, to have some good fun. All of these points will improve our sense of well being.I like this particular Mandala coloring book by Marty Noble because it is a bit more complicated that her other mandala coloring books.  These are very traditional type designs that exhibit ancient sacred designs that span across several spiritual traditions.  They are easily removed from the book to work one at a time.  Four Star:  The designs are on each page, front and back.  This means you cannot use alcohol markers or markers that will bleed through the paper and ruin the other side.  Use high quality coloring pencils for best results.Creative Suggestion: Is to put your favorite design on an overhead projector, shine it on a chosen spot on a blank canvas and trace it. Then fill in with acrylics or oils or even water colors. Or you could complete this same process and project on a wall.

However, the payoff is immense. These images are beautifully done, and the work you do on them will inspire you.You may want to photocopy the pages if you wish to display or use each one, since they are printed back-to-back.Just beautifully done!"	2	-0.235089	0.359823	0.085973	-0.134276	0.095283	0.341890	-0.182602	0.204615	0.022988	-0.032577	0.100670	-0.075850	0.227368	-0.076636	0.081393	-0.030085	0.094835	0.328407	-0.224462	0.155507	0.100340	-0.004155	0.070221	-0.208667	0.218140	-0.049049	-0.161109	-0.269388	0.081602	-0.348569	0.040452	0.354336	-0.187768	-0.039019	0.069127	0.220367	-0.111898	0.035988	-0.075468	-0.272020	-0.129140	-0.291422	-0.132310	-0.263597	-0.296398	-0.046577	0.128560	-0.157087	0.054510	-0.629810	0.127309	-0.022579	0.099279	0.970287	0.024153	-1.860654	0.043248	-0.042655	1.288731	0.102507	-0.104026	0.938816	-0.301358	0.030191	0.689184	0.078785	0.447665	0.102607	0.020615	-0.263149	0.126996	-0.002201	0.074331	-0.284549	0.257166	0.141187	-0.104956	0.057386	-0.379048	-0.017113	0.372442	-0.091911	-0.366689	0.071691	-1.211169	-0.138316	0.206238	-0.153191	-0.203894	-0.244800	-0.053059	-0.052473	0.088398	-0.161261	-0.400773	-0.200225	-0.250514	-0.296277	0.299889	0.248643
toy	"Oh, and for my teenager too.  Because that's who I really ordered it for.  Honest.  But, I am going to borrow it.  I call it sharing.I ordered several of these - different designs - but all by Dover and Marty Noble.  Of all of them, this is my favorite DESIGN  - but least favorite layout.  It doesn't take up the entire page like the rest of the books do. The design is in the center, and there is quite a bit of white, blank page, left all around it on every side.  What you see on the cover, is probably the biggest design in all of the book.  I will try to get a picture of the inside in the next few days, and post it here for you to see.Despite that, I do love the design.  (Just wish it were bigger, taking up more of the page.)  I love coloring.  It doesn't matter to me what it is, I just like to color.  I love that I have small children still (9 and 2) that I can color with, without looking completely silly (Not that I'd really care).  Coloring is relaxing.I stumbled across this book when I was looking for art supplies, and coloring books for my 17-year-old. (I typed in 'coloring book for teens' on a whim).  And I was happy to find these designs by Marty Noble.  The price was reasonable, and the quality is nice.  It's not a thick (lots of pages) coloring book like you would find for small children, only around 40 pages, I think.  But the pages aren't thin like a child's coloring book either.  They are a little thicker.  A little better quality.  Nice bold white sheets.  I'm thinking you may be able to use markers on this without them bleeding through, but I don't know for sure yet.  I'm going to try it.I'm pleased with my purchase, and will definitely be ordering more."	2	-0.109202	0.297448	0.219627	-0.222600	-0.048695	0.284195	-0.079286	0.124946	0.022696	-0.069315	0.202162	-0.023779	0.182517	0.000693	0.083703	-0.083529	0.078144	0.164031	-0.203197	0.235966	0.120055	0.118653	0.053919	-0.161049	0.222972	0.020422	-0.091132	-0.447919	-0.033493	-0.139377	-0.022134	0.399618	0.008462	-0.141819	0.102533	0.288507	-0.114410	0.138188	0.072593	-0.192829	-0.171061	-0.238048	-0.005471	-0.337996	-0.282964	-0.044284	0.028669	-0.168435	0.029992	-0.650410	0.192810	-0.075441	0.079924	0.884726	-0.177171	-2.019083	0.037713	0.022824	1.296733	0.230071	-0.040916	0.844055	-0.331299	0.027109	0.693138	-0.024881	0.476778	0.258254	-0.031443	-0.216050	0.006907	-0.118654	0.011996	-0.258466	0.141473	0.189529	-0.028647	0.033935	-0.518958	-0.064303	0.304102	-0.028249	-0.400721	0.026118	-1.175791	-0.194090	0.060992	-0.245825	-0.277391	-0.201595	-0.062914	-0.070193	0.101579	-0.119926	-0.483811	-0.055869	-0.283572	-0.286470	0.331121	0.272847

toy	"I just recieved my copy of decorative tile designs, and I was thrilled with the actual contents. However, this product could have been a bit better if they had been printed on one sided paper. (or even paper that was a bit thicker) It is impossible to use paints or markers on these pages, and crayons would be entirely too wide to use effectively due to the very small spaces on a good deal of the designs.. I don't mind using colored pencils, so I'm not completely disappointed, but the ability to use markers without serious bleed-through would have made this product worth five stars. All in all, this is definitely best for an older child or adult, especially if they love coloring with pencils and/or like intricate patterns."	2	-0.118197	0.333399	0.144032	-0.131970	0.029240	0.149891	-0.050624	0.088976	0.087551	0.056106	0.076059	-0.113153	0.246895	0.025975	0.158979	-0.044901	0.121120	0.221079	0.013459	0.031970	0.052160	-0.000062	0.090839	-0.089083	0.253155	-0.087737	-0.004750	-0.345420	-0.095270	-0.172525	0.086353	0.366781	-0.185327	-0.147003	0.168115	0.242338	-0.076457	0.041781	-0.082835	-0.125778	-0.118338	-0.268809	-0.109334	-0.277560	-0.284715	-0.101658	0.063545	-0.100490	-0.110113	-0.647952	0.151967	0.009116	0.105665	0.840447	-0.078711	-1.658053	0.026913	-0.056310	1.190343	0.192719	-0.065657	0.759357	-0.274978	0.191024	0.614608	-0.127285	0.506676	0.165916	0.043717	-0.338530	-0.036357	-0.043276	0.196900	-0.143886	0.236276	0.147471	-0.062962	0.122979	-0.471420	0.000309	0.309179	-0.075750	-0.439478	0.153137	-1.180835	-0.113135	0.155286	-0.172023	-0.221339	-0.136869	-0.175478	-0.108716	-0.017510	-0.125163	-0.351792	-0.136111	-0.366306	-0.363505	0.396793	0.143080

toy	"This is a great sticker book, with large rings in the middle for easy page turning.  The pages are each filled with colorful pictures that your child (or you) can fill with all kinds of stickers that they want to keep.  The book is the right material to allow the stickers to be moved (though they still lose their ability to be moved over time), and it even comes with a couple of stickers in the middle.  These stickers are in a pouch at the back, which can be used in the future to store full sheets of stickers (or stickers that have not yet made it into the book)."	2	-0.179052	0.306140	0.104946	-0.367228	0.132921	0.336473	-0.213885	0.104404	0.077650	-0.055820	0.125613	-0.098870	0.186531	0.133472	0.213149	-0.017933	0.267302	0.138408	-0.105739	-0.020094	0.131801	0.084549	0.042173	-0.114331	0.337904	-0.028798	-0.189491	-0.359184	-0.026772	-0.223774	0.218064	0.345932	-0.077952	-0.005922	0.032663	0.302220	-0.072038	0.004971	-0.077501	-0.156191	-0.141196	-0.279372	0.029694	-0.387876	-0.240321	-0.150880	0.038388	-0.130979	-0.014174	-0.580592	0.217423	-0.006884	0.022971	0.906062	-0.066624	-1.858285	-0.017729	-0.077635	1.346223	0.239148	-0.117358	0.835112	-0.166578	0.055369	0.664812	-0.025239	0.503022	0.211609	0.054646	-0.293675	0.086240	-0.062873	0.029877	-0.283792	0.062909	0.341322	-0.016879	0.099641	-0.460407	-0.053350	0.351343	-0.121532	-0.403589	-0.035097	-0.979653	-0.183502	0.070652	-0.378573	-0.171876	-0.105864	-0.151873	0.086209	0.198458	-0.179571	-0.503815	-0.207520	-0.217635	-0.151336	0.477731	0.244473

toy	"We thought this might be a nice place for my 2 year-old daughter to collect her reward stickers instead of on sticker charts that just get thrown in the trash.  The quality of this book is fantastic.  It has a very heavy, sturdy cover and thick pages that are coated to allow for removal and re-sticking.Each page has different, fun scenery, which makes it visually appealing even when there aren't a ton of stickers on that particular page.  My daughter is so excited to earn stickers and put them in this book, and she even enjoys spending time just flipping through the pages and admiring her collection.  I can foresee this lasting until she's pretty much bored with collecting stickers, and that's a couple years down the road."	2	-0.199372	0.292595	0.132292	-0.216189	0.087855	0.280891	-0.131020	0.209124	0.046395	-0.004408	0.172815	-0.005394	0.086851	-0.093552	0.174617	-0.046789	0.203653	0.062343	-0.037580	0.194611	0.162806	0.145924	-0.005213	-0.134838	0.296793	-0.020925	-0.212243	-0.348504	-0.046364	-0.230709	0.039465	0.255730	0.007783	-0.068750	0.061814	0.223479	-0.104365	0.004556	-0.073410	-0.096655	-0.103139	-0.220630	0.079126	-0.304853	-0.257665	-0.078657	0.047700	-0.189721	-0.006161	-0.576767	0.239041	-0.201465	0.049327	0.855763	-0.097490	-1.609096	0.068854	0.027772	1.092562	0.182516	-0.054142	0.744983	-0.281615	0.109824	0.519798	-0.008783	0.414746	0.193731	0.068177	-0.324503	0.083232	-0.036341	0.115419	-0.125344	0.066652	0.304217	0.027514	-0.021658	-0.448167	-0.079059	0.328159	-0.014009	-0.334474	-0.071364	-0.909017	-0.187437	0.041943	-0.318806	-0.308934	-0.157581	-0.065171	0.008888	0.099346	-0.241293	-0.395173	-0.208100	-0.257531	-0.134371	0.354833	0.223216
toy	"All 3 of my kids love these books! They carry them every where and they keep them entertained for hours! Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around, add more stickers and is happy as a clam! The books are of amazing quality, stickers can be pulled off, moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers. The stickers that you can order from the website are the best. You cannot buy anything like them. My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc. Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids. They love to earn and trade for new stickers. These books make a great birthday gift, party favor and holiday present."	2	-0.070121	0.261193	0.120186	-0.381965	0.017841	0.323018	-0.126672	0.120714	-0.043198	-0.112336	0.156054	-0.037240	0.086661	0.111016	0.152609	-0.124070	0.305900	0.244929	-0.249669	0.291603	0.252623	0.109752	0.115534	-0.107445	0.286045	0.102750	-0.205707	-0.298178	0.061198	-0.212331	0.106970	0.429781	0.068426	0.033407	0.033268	0.346654	-0.041074	0.053417	-0.118703	-0.322457	-0.035957	-0.202505	-0.030127	-0.438252	-0.162531	-0.133371	-0.147277	-0.146529	-0.021711	-0.655261	0.095247	-0.097654	-0.041094	0.829242	-0.196394	-1.751766	0.039509	0.083684	1.257502	0.203157	-0.134300	0.785291	-0.305434	0.017691	0.477306	0.082285	0.365414	0.238804	0.185796	-0.289296	0.090964	-0.101938	-0.015612	-0.223822	-0.055266	0.399195	-0.054762	0.025738	-0.455463	-0.075632	0.340780	-0.209756	-0.338774	0.003816	-0.913825	-0.130261	-0.087345	-0.232580	-0.213102	-0.071865	-0.113914	0.029258	0.172194	-0.218990	-0.679752	-0.289522	-0.151363	-0.105994	0.519419	0.292046

toy	I have to praise amazon for having this product at a great price.  We actually picked one up at Barnes and Noble and I couldn't bring myself to pay $20+ dollars for a simple stuffed animal that feels painfully like a claw-machine reject.  That said my five-year-old daughter has put her llama to bed every night since Christmas while reading it llama llama stories.  I hope it holds up better than it feels like it should...	2	0.045943	0.382129	0.205040	-0.246030	0.030442	0.131876	0.005368	0.159093	-0.085939	-0.137688	0.006879	0.034073	0.206778	0.026027	0.094019	-0.125068	0.075574	0.119135	-0.267834	0.307247	0.267302	0.045252	-0.014609	0.020019	0.238457	0.144252	-0.176159	-0.409313	-0.070878	-0.149908	0.023201	0.323247	-0.011514	-0.025065	0.123539	0.302136	-0.051242	0.118169	0.061056	-0.166121	-0.161211	-0.124425	0.119697	-0.301215	-0.141411	0.005321	-0.102714	-0.200426	-0.029163	-0.559589	0.021853	-0.117405	0.167336	0.767171	-0.178233	-1.733289	-0.102424	0.013444	1.160289	0.280280	0.084560	0.540648	-0.262367	0.016794	0.429713	0.068255	0.399836	0.199086	0.063461	-0.141506	0.045371	-0.058089	-0.033303	-0.120711	0.105516	0.186107	-0.136110	-0.080276	-0.599590	-0.014703	0.349841	0.038378	-0.321719	-0.013205	-0.979337	-0.182366	-0.001827	-0.216170	-0.145561	-0.176945	0.064814	-0.036793	0.065688	-0.062703	-0.564847	-0.114547	-0.164271	-0.204272	0.402561	0.096919

toy	"I LOVE the illustrations on these flashcards. That is what prompted me to buy them for my daughter's second birthday. The cards are very sturdy and have a nice weight and finish to them. My one issue is trying to keep them together. The ring that holds the card together is kind of flimsy. There is value in having the cards be detachable but I almost wish the ring was more permanent. It can be frustrating when you are missing cards. Overall, these are the most attractive, charming ABC flashcards I have ever found. I think I may have been a little too eager though because my daughter is only 2 and she doesn't seem that interested yet. But if you want some nice sturdy flashcards with charming, frameworthy illustrations I would buy these."	2	-0.016517	0.255062	0.187134	-0.183482	0.003896	0.211046	-0.101825	0.068227	-0.000875	-0.080994	0.106211	0.066182	0.104707	0.012993	0.093216	-0.068402	0.090438	0.160530	-0.062191	0.266577	0.144670	0.040640	0.081724	-0.154040	0.251634	-0.151849	-0.111322	-0.368403	-0.016328	-0.161287	-0.028794	0.340702	-0.017756	-0.153851	0.245596	0.235347	0.009263	0.036287	0.014064	-0.207431	0.030985	-0.167190	0.160950	-0.373697	-0.247009	-0.084474	0.101287	-0.012888	-0.002372	-0.638031	0.034073	-0.086194	0.173143	0.736633	0.043856	-1.745859	0.039488	-0.054342	1.026190	0.174037	-0.144343	0.727664	-0.282919	0.025223	0.460941	-0.054042	0.351658	0.336300	0.069286	-0.304657	-0.013554	-0.133828	0.025963	-0.144826	0.077139	0.370948	-0.103571	-0.049655	-0.468285	-0.048867	0.376235	0.019417	-0.272596	-0.007284	-1.020164	-0.268418	0.081767	-0.103667	-0.161822	-0.208640	-0.099826	-0.001531	0.202644	-0.262047	-0.403432	-0.101757	-0.250669	-0.232245	0.218981	0.170066
toy	"I am so delighted with these flashcards. I actually ordered the 'My first words' version of these and liked them so much I went back and ordered these. I had not heard of the mudpuppy brand before, but I'm looking into see what other products they make. My son is 16 months old, so these are a great toy to help him start to point out animals and make noises, as well as to learn his ABCs.  (The only watch out is that some of the animals I could not think what noises they make!) It is fun for us to go through the ring together or they are easy enough for him to manipulate that he can entertain himself by using them on his own. Given his age, a lot of things still end up in his mouth, including these cards. They have held up very well and aren't completely destroyed! The designs are very cute and this is something that I can see us getting a lot of use out of for the next year or two.  I liked them so much, I ordered another ring for an upcoming trip---they seem like a great plane ride activity.Also, I would highly recommend getting theSecure-A-Toy, BLACK-WHITEto go with this. I used this to strap the rings to the carseat and the stroller, so he can thumb through the cards on his own, but not lose them if he decides to throw them. If you have not used these in general, I highly suggest, as I've found a ton of uses over the last few weeks...they're especially great when traveling."	2	-0.055415	0.229736	0.246855	-0.269264	-0.127762	0.163009	-0.118307	0.190150	-0.022474	-0.115054	0.077038	0.002877	0.217049	0.078390	0.112248	-0.168993	0.076280	0.256929	-0.283882	0.215093	0.264038	0.008369	0.080801	-0.143859	0.142811	-0.002729	-0.223620	-0.357772	0.130312	-0.062840	-0.065811	0.374512	-0.052997	-0.025362	0.176693	0.223192	-0.071210	0.116880	0.044620	-0.198698	-0.204003	-0.191484	0.097512	-0.387335	-0.188456	0.001258	0.107417	-0.197012	0.041896	-0.745654	0.029760	-0.034774	0.119377	0.867519	-0.110466	-1.961341	-0.064993	-0.012365	1.310760	0.320642	-0.091894	0.894751	-0.214554	0.105836	0.606633	0.023971	0.371921	0.247007	0.016645	-0.159035	0.002386	-0.218811	0.008369	-0.257952	0.053476	0.178114	-0.103042	-0.012864	-0.578744	0.005555	0.488257	-0.067034	-0.440471	0.044621	-1.274859	-0.163268	0.066043	-0.192495	-0.271500	-0.232598	-0.045049	-0.080062	0.050387	-0.115938	-0.444656	-0.164751	-0.345356	-0.219892	0.427940	0.133429

toy	"After reading the reviews of others, I still purchased this toy as well as the one to make silly faces of the same make - I also purchased a couple of small magnetic boards (after reading that the actual sheets to put the magnets on are not magnetic) and clip the sheets onto the magnetic board before having my grandson put the magnetic pieces in place - this works out quite well!  But, yes, I agree the sheets should be magnetic that's why I did not give this toy 5 stars!  These toys are great for stimulating imaginative play as well as learning face/body parts!"	2	-0.117842	0.328812	0.103119	-0.250508	0.065707	0.149131	-0.070098	0.176841	-0.141874	-0.047778	0.138862	-0.186834	0.097436	0.132348	0.187086	-0.097613	0.192101	0.238642	-0.072316	0.107636	0.267406	0.026378	0.050792	-0.104057	0.218773	0.019249	-0.156660	-0.186338	-0.016058	-0.056224	0.077015	0.371828	-0.156809	0.000923	-0.004505	0.056196	0.073859	0.108169	-0.134975	-0.393474	-0.178960	-0.169378	-0.011858	-0.271445	-0.244498	-0.050500	0.020467	-0.079375	0.037419	-0.475734	0.049285	-0.030203	0.084547	0.803353	0.016637	-1.800390	-0.046963	-0.026531	1.195171	0.288249	-0.088837	0.820700	-0.249394	0.256109	0.559257	0.010102	0.423486	0.310568	0.074225	-0.197893	0.016311	-0.031602	0.272331	-0.155168	0.117879	0.205321	0.025527	-0.056790	-0.372446	-0.012342	0.435142	-0.003300	-0.408198	0.007097	-1.133688	-0.211124	0.117950	-0.225264	-0.077384	-0.197954	-0.054887	-0.015241	0.085445	-0.061120	-0.328084	-0.077523	-0.242775	-0.253340	0.480948	0.044320
toy	"My 3 year old son is obsessed with robots! So when you can build robots with magnets, WONDERFUL!He doesn't really use the ""backdrops"" that come with the little set, he uses the magnets on our fridge or dishwasher, which is just fine by me! He does, however, keep all the magnets in the metal tin they came in! I think it's because there's a cool robot on the front. =) The robot pieces are so unique! Not your plain old everyday robots, oh no! You can use radios, lamps, even mechanical cats to build your robots!

toy	"This is a very nice magnet set and the milk-carton box it comes in is adorable.  The quality of the printing on the animals (which are very cute - just not ) just isn't as crisp the photos online suggest -- which detracts slightly from the overall great quality and cute artistry. I wish the colors were a little brighter, but I guess the softness gives the animals a gentleness that they might not otherwise have.  I love how there are different versions of the animals.  As another reviewer said, many have a mom, dad, and baby to match up with.  My 2.5 year old likes it when I pick out a baby and make him ""talk"" and say ""where is my mommy/(daddy)?"" and then she searches for the mom (or dad).  She likes to make the animals ""ride"" on the tractor and feed them the apples or hay.  When we put them away, I pretend like the top of the box is a hungry mouth and she loves throwing the magnets into the mouth (kinda goofy, but at least it gets her to help a little...I guess).  They seem to stick pretty well and I haven't had any peeling issues.  If it ever goes for ten bucks, I would grab it.  We paid sixteen, and I guess it's worth it for the box and quantity and I think these guys are so much cuter than the Melissa & Doug animals, but still...a few bucks less would have been nice! :)  We also have their sweets & treats magnet set and my daughter loves that."	2	-0.052681	0.318704	0.375041	-0.379709	-0.138785	0.179333	-0.037256	0.140753	0.048053	-0.133664	0.073215	0.002693	0.184316	0.066480	0.185123	-0.043701	0.047767	0.188390	-0.126602	0.396874	0.191902	0.130775	0.017822	-0.182356	0.220199	0.174854	-0.244560	-0.401443	-0.063034	-0.128630	-0.049554	0.402952	0.103223	0.006828	0.100418	0.244921	-0.100735	0.129632	0.044732	-0.270418	-0.046739	-0.206459	-0.062700	-0.390994	-0.234212	-0.013191	-0.050323	-0.113311	0.003027	-0.582598	0.022903	-0.138029	0.068432	0.742324	-0.105153	-1.635305	-0.044080	0.029474	0.910302	0.170313	0.015910	0.757427	-0.290141	0.103795	0.522847	0.070811	0.401234	0.148350	0.054906	-0.165601	0.067979	-0.137802	0.045381	-0.076492	0.142390	0.276895	-0.069460	-0.123901	-0.385889	0.011569	0.324539	-0.019081	-0.383692	0.025739	-1.082154	-0.250860	0.013512	-0.136391	-0.213921	-0.155700	-0.002862	0.001669	0.059312	-0.201225	-0.493766	-0.156353	-0.297052	-0.181060	0.379336	0.177574

toy	"My son is almost two and has had these on his magnet board in his playroom for a few months now. He likes the farmer and the tractor magnets the best and we use the animals to work with animal sounds often. These are small (which I know, it's in the description). The artwork is pretty cute and the magnet part does it's job. They come in really cute packaging...my friend used them in her little one's Easter basket, which was great visual display. But really for $18 they are more of an item I'd expect to find in an overpriced Boutique. Once they get out of the cute carton packaging they are just your ordinary $1 bin magnets."	2	-0.011917	0.331384	0.197780	-0.338944	-0.033866	0.140997	-0.021809	0.183408	0.057877	-0.062895	0.046734	-0.119888	0.198767	0.075147	0.200060	-0.001515	0.151963	0.172924	-0.101378	0.268213	0.161722	0.079091	0.070147	-0.254389	0.181836	0.013390	-0.251919	-0.344277	-0.155660	-0.091033	-0.059732	0.373673	0.040566	-0.046790	0.051966	0.254708	-0.089275	0.146873	0.107000	-0.404850	-0.026096	-0.099679	0.059838	-0.342481	-0.188034	0.012867	0.047125	-0.030335	0.000819	-0.581258	-0.027137	-0.120460	0.095539	0.718881	-0.090615	-1.686224	-0.070884	-0.023050	1.095104	0.137802	0.039649	0.775078	-0.207960	0.177536	0.577183	-0.019663	0.452010	0.170311	0.064001	-0.192875	0.032391	-0.191742	0.114653	-0.116353	0.110542	0.197853	0.004880	-0.081087	-0.440164	0.002962	0.332051	0.003063	-0.360992	-0.024019	-1.147664	-0.187837	0.069807	-0.202877	-0.220158	-0.310680	-0.010932	0.032011	0.238014	-0.144616	-0.379021	-0.120649	-0.355468	-0.292115	0.407839	0.156447
toy	"I appreciate the materials used to create this puzzle and our three year-old loves the picture that is formed when the puzzle is complete. Soy inks + recycled cardboard = Wonderful.I have only one criticism, and it's a minor one. Since the puzzle is intended for a younger audience, it might be nice if the pieces were a bit thicker. Our son has good fine motor skills, but the pieces can still bend and crease as he works to fit them together. With that said however, the creasing may be due more to his impatience when the pieces don't seem to fit right than with the build quality of the puzzle."	2	-0.095355	0.424117	0.130823	-0.156530	-0.007187	0.092077	0.083433	0.033021	0.002504	0.052669	0.029758	-0.061093	0.207855	-0.028620	0.034420	-0.027822	0.126227	0.161418	-0.102078	0.103669	0.091845	0.013200	0.044932	-0.204380	0.284773	-0.108509	-0.130394	-0.308627	-0.024162	-0.048282	-0.100334	0.322374	-0.158556	-0.205941	0.061134	0.237538	0.061099	0.106318	-0.033653	-0.238581	-0.111660	-0.169355	0.052200	-0.350579	-0.240380	0.016204	0.087174	-0.137464	0.002085	-0.520951	0.094117	-0.121107	0.147256	0.793834	0.056241	-1.750335	-0.126308	-0.038749	1.048583	0.318839	-0.103878	0.849011	-0.323976	0.219847	0.511778	-0.054618	0.416392	0.214098	-0.015314	-0.237517	0.084631	0.044676	0.123599	-0.140850	0.241129	0.156549	-0.120157	0.042680	-0.330685	0.062549	0.280337	0.012258	-0.317350	0.040035	-1.108755	-0.134651	0.005099	-0.094515	-0.275296	-0.153277	-0.082997	-0.083925	-0.046525	-0.075698	-0.311862	-0.083664	-0.266112	-0.408984	0.421974	0.173578
toy	"I love the larger size pieces (these are about the size of my HAND) for little fingers and older hands. My granddaughter was excited when I received this and immediately read the top ""At the Zoo."" Yes, she is old enough to assemble it for herself.For those who have younger kids (age 2 or so) who enjoy putting puzzles together, one of the ways to handle this is to give them two pieces at a time and have them figure out which way to put them. It gives beginning skills, AND gives a chance for social interaction.I have worked with the elderly at nursing homes and am always looking for puzzles for aging arthritic hands as well. This is bright and cheerful enough to use there, especially when we assemble it with grandkids!The pieces are sturdy (seem just a bit thicker than standard puzzle pieces) but aren't for kids who still chew. They won't choke on these, but they could ""mush"" them up a bit.Bright, cheerful, fun, and best of all, huge pieces.I have removed a star because the size of the cuts themselves (holes and tabs) seem very much alike and don't give visual clues. A child who is not looking at the pattern could easily smash them together and insist that they fit."	2	-0.119875	0.405031	0.213974	-0.162815	-0.122027	0.234870	-0.117811	0.067307	0.009297	-0.045604	0.108701	-0.012235	0.175316	0.012344	0.135443	-0.145884	0.040167	0.203759	-0.165328	0.199760	0.075713	0.060342	0.045907	-0.205540	0.249448	-0.043051	-0.213492	-0.376149	0.023910	-0.106623	0.014389	0.318837	-0.059663	-0.133849	0.119830	0.177561	-0.046970	0.113797	0.055404	-0.178284	-0.144465	-0.252312	-0.037795	-0.317534	-0.269846	-0.010457	0.049844	-0.017129	0.007504	-0.556475	0.013621	-0.208164	0.068662	0.868806	0.025641	-1.786520	0.012880	-0.063616	1.146091	0.312760	-0.057437	0.906885	-0.299010	0.160966	0.519129	-0.013676	0.389126	0.209338	0.085595	-0.205131	0.093649	-0.114139	0.084529	-0.201700	0.178807	0.178524	-0.204477	-0.075821	-0.302927	-0.092772	0.396384	0.005572	-0.329917	-0.004860	-1.209623	-0.187178	0.042755	-0.053634	-0.334383	-0.150181	-0.050879	-0.036527	0.102406	-0.177786	-0.475278	-0.193365	-0.318922	-0.326687	0.436488	0.240174
toy	"A very cute puzzle. Nice that it comes in a top-loading box that's big enough to put pieces in edge-wise. Box is big enough that even smaller kids can put it away after putting it together.Puzzle has very large pieces that are easy for little hands to grasp.It's still the same fiberboard stuff that most puzzles are made of, which can be easily damaged, which would be my only complaint for small children (wood is far more sturdy, so I knocked off a star for that.)Still a very cute puzzle for the little ones they'll want to do over & over. Edges get worn a little bit on the corners, but other than that, it's beautiful & easy to put away. Box even has a handle so they can put it away all by themselves."	2	-0.217983	0.391306	0.342897	-0.302375	-0.093862	0.230238	-0.154504	0.042229	0.061842	-0.078679	0.226296	0.082987	0.137583	0.082341	0.089562	-0.047642	0.050962	0.262304	-0.099441	0.150875	0.261567	0.209551	0.128595	-0.286527	0.298235	-0.009954	-0.260920	-0.333657	-0.145326	-0.207458	0.031885	0.263306	0.026541	-0.076978	0.190482	0.175676	-0.067118	0.122865	0.046754	-0.207775	-0.158469	-0.347082	0.002977	-0.423050	-0.199233	-0.033115	0.084403	-0.005696	0.033913	-0.484062	0.034747	-0.129747	0.026806	0.936095	0.008410	-2.069248	-0.071105	-0.011298	1.289568	0.329642	-0.104687	0.859107	-0.341927	0.285438	0.550093	-0.057477	0.457018	0.337663	-0.015287	-0.263550	0.087764	-0.105524	0.088899	-0.189915	0.221904	0.160161	-0.206546	-0.010321	-0.313407	0.150109	0.428561	-0.003551	-0.493108	0.009666	-1.186394	-0.301828	0.076158	0.006617	-0.307249	-0.180976	-0.056498	-0.035948	-0.045156	-0.169137	-0.494164	-0.209205	-0.295025	-0.172209	0.493551	0.231982
toy	"We've picked up Melissa and Doug, Ravensburger, and now Mudpuppy floor puzzles for our daughter.  I like all of them, and they each have good points and not so good points, but the wonderful thing about the Mudpuppy puzzle is it's in a box with a handle, so that she can carry it around.  We love involved activities that travel well, and this is a good choice for a puzzle-crazy toddler.  The picture is bright and has clearly-drawn animals that she enjoys, and the pieces fit well together, but not as well as the Ravensburger or even the Melissa and Doug.  The carrying-case cancels that out, in my opinion, because it's a great grab-and-go item for a trip."	2	-0.070166	0.256557	0.279936	-0.308083	0.007784	0.185636	-0.026046	0.054210	-0.084589	-0.174145	0.109484	-0.033009	0.173382	0.012372	0.001476	-0.051490	0.026361	0.195489	-0.290770	0.216604	0.143370	0.133411	0.116608	-0.184037	0.237560	0.009126	-0.212418	-0.253000	-0.074857	-0.113242	-0.161330	0.303339	-0.017074	-0.044949	0.129880	0.156342	-0.043848	0.147672	-0.038605	-0.188286	-0.159984	-0.152213	0.099966	-0.348060	-0.259940	0.047762	-0.105762	-0.145137	-0.021962	-0.547263	0.166935	-0.036852	0.063879	0.839500	0.006869	-1.824014	-0.008750	0.080882	1.049759	0.311441	-0.156381	0.777317	-0.235653	0.041189	0.490842	0.073627	0.416710	0.288653	0.078777	-0.097258	-0.032125	-0.121395	0.098531	-0.141547	0.133725	0.249149	-0.169924	-0.061635	-0.354567	-0.024003	0.317225	0.078680	-0.262725	0.004577	-1.076950	-0.261070	-0.026486	-0.091725	-0.275812	-0.236315	-0.112315	-0.059759	0.065428	-0.108706	-0.396209	-0.040846	-0.284217	-0.244221	0.344030	0.235756
toy	"My daughter is an official puzzle connoisseur.  We have a shelf devoted just to puzzles.  Floor puzzles are her current favorite, and she loved this one.  The pieces are big and easy to maneuver, the colors are bright and cheery, and the zoo scene is very cute.  She loves the elephant spraying water and always puts that section together first.  For kid appeal, it gets an A plus.From a mom's perspective, I love the box.  It's sturdy and has held up well to dumping the pieces out and putting them back.  I like the carrying strap too - nice touch.  The puzzle pieces themselves are made of a thick cardboard.  While my daughter has outgrown this stage, it does say the pieces are made with nontoxic paints so it's okay if your child happens to gnaw on them while assembling the puzzle.  My only complaint is with snapping the pieces together - they don't seem to hold together as well as our Melissa and Doug puzzles.  For an adult it's really not a big deal, but it can sometimes be frustrating for my daughter when the pieces keep snapping back apart on their own.Overall, it's a cute puzzle. I'm not sure how long it will hold up given that the pieces don't have a firm lock, but it's still a nice addition to our puzzle collection."	2	-0.149360	0.351275	0.221742	-0.204184	0.012888	0.241979	0.019158	0.116410	-0.003296	-0.077723	0.180728	0.007109	0.165999	0.079676	-0.013457	0.005644	0.062236	0.155076	-0.029436	0.138940	0.084186	0.133331	0.090351	-0.208842	0.330339	-0.002238	-0.253289	-0.301835	-0.074285	-0.105313	-0.121894	0.218721	0.010362	-0.049979	0.046699	0.142133	-0.035725	0.070492	0.132008	-0.284387	-0.017259	-0.177053	0.077815	-0.360616	-0.262516	0.007656	-0.113082	-0.026629	0.011422	-0.416355	0.075028	-0.096844	0.117498	0.761666	-0.050296	-1.690480	-0.057013	0.013323	0.961786	0.298402	-0.031358	0.826431	-0.249704	0.152106	0.446376	0.002213	0.410991	0.244538	-0.016852	-0.174596	0.091049	-0.021586	0.127374	-0.080758	0.094156	0.238971	-0.175177	-0.057169	-0.300459	0.008786	0.264900	0.023910	-0.230536	0.059888	-1.001782	-0.213350	-0.073139	-0.084735	-0.284935	-0.144703	-0.030958	-0.001410	0.103445	-0.150545	-0.324538	-0.133947	-0.325637	-0.275079	0.426972	0.214557

toy	"This is a nice size and is made very well. The pieces are very sturdy.  Once your child uses perceptual, and fine-motor skills to put the puzzles together you can use the puzzle to learn about various animal such the koala, ploar bear, lion.  The sturdiness of the product means it will be long-lasting.  The box has a neat rope handle for little ones to use when taking their special puzzle from room to room or from house to house. Puzzles are becoming a fogotten activity/skill but I am glad that this one was a big hit.  I recommend it for children 3-8."	2	-0.101479	0.359865	0.089359	-0.079977	-0.087747	0.131894	-0.069346	0.131489	-0.055970	-0.068554	0.111235	-0.125302	0.121573	0.091230	0.087583	0.098411	0.163411	0.250825	-0.183507	0.145731	0.103910	-0.044252	0.068315	-0.266251	0.220391	-0.012194	-0.224627	-0.244161	-0.191024	-0.068071	-0.083694	0.251708	-0.091624	-0.107894	0.116362	0.198941	-0.068383	0.126714	0.106468	-0.205499	-0.048221	-0.233321	0.043763	-0.341467	-0.165104	0.059576	-0.009036	-0.106987	-0.048939	-0.457393	-0.050086	-0.161110	0.005321	0.857640	0.017536	-1.780623	-0.031476	-0.157419	1.149099	0.293908	-0.077999	0.720888	-0.236338	0.177155	0.498778	-0.012115	0.270108	0.159809	0.230933	-0.157695	-0.046527	-0.058361	0.133646	-0.045644	0.170876	0.238411	-0.192651	-0.026764	-0.359009	0.067671	0.276343	0.020909	-0.262830	-0.002845	-1.088131	-0.039819	0.103953	-0.171190	-0.204225	-0.182734	-0.053205	-0.030635	0.094734	-0.134210	-0.291586	-0.170740	-0.280255	-0.396795	0.637906	0.088356
toy	"The Mudpuppy At the Zoo Jumbo Floor puzzle was my 2.5 year old grandson's first jigsaw puzzle. He loved it and we have had great fun with it. Before we even opened the box, he enjoyed the picture of the puzzle and naming all the animals at the zoo. When we dumped out the pieces on the playroom floor, he got very excited. I tried to get him to do the border first but he is still a little young so I helped him to put it together. Then with the inside pieces left, we talked about what each piece looked like from the picture and found a place for it. After the first few tries of fitting pieces in correctly, he got the hang of it and did it on his own. We did it a couple of more times and he didn't seem to tire of it. He liked leaving it together when he went to take a nap. I think it is a wonderful, educational toy and fun one for first timers like he is. I think 2-3 is about the right age to start it and children a little older should be able to easily do it on their own. Sturdy, bright and well made!"	2	-0.055669	0.341700	0.265489	-0.236398	-0.073867	0.224963	0.068212	0.123575	-0.038323	-0.124386	0.218104	0.003293	0.126888	0.036708	0.125384	-0.098588	0.172435	0.243014	-0.245474	0.131767	0.252680	0.144668	0.119588	-0.133083	0.312152	-0.107666	-0.239601	-0.324615	0.003440	-0.065887	-0.120516	0.385713	0.028506	-0.011335	0.066718	0.130307	-0.114553	0.229755	0.068691	-0.239192	-0.126166	-0.197158	0.092469	-0.352284	-0.151747	0.017406	0.017807	-0.067272	0.082749	-0.545355	-0.059656	-0.174589	0.083911	0.861327	-0.140317	-2.055358	-0.160876	0.020834	1.139088	0.395615	-0.116224	0.906707	-0.281998	0.165275	0.540911	0.011566	0.362705	0.303951	-0.005385	-0.093767	0.030965	-0.057670	0.071789	-0.145559	0.055839	0.190695	-0.165041	-0.064685	-0.415230	-0.026853	0.310334	0.063349	-0.316209	0.060419	-1.109150	-0.216852	0.013379	-0.134747	-0.259809	-0.141021	0.039867	-0.100025	0.082755	-0.091855	-0.537315	-0.137733	-0.260825	-0.221424	0.393418	0.117184

toy	"When I read the description, I visualized a HUGE puzzle with GIGANTIC puzzle pieces. These aren't. They are a little bigger than most, but not much. It comes in a cute little box with a rope handle to make it easy to carry around. I love the pictures and the colors. Getting a small child to sit still long enough to put it together is another thing entirely. Good luck with that!"	2	-0.183460	0.422707	0.265164	-0.279497	-0.082850	0.276080	-0.137502	0.065809	0.052304	-0.151005	0.186289	0.093672	0.198145	0.074617	0.151952	-0.082899	0.068151	0.305039	-0.095169	0.186652	0.208523	0.136375	0.030422	-0.309791	0.265008	0.034086	-0.291004	-0.259759	-0.017302	-0.180500	-0.062727	0.274920	0.027212	-0.131614	0.198410	0.172935	-0.058057	0.110887	0.127040	-0.230694	-0.117450	-0.139924	0.000552	-0.397359	-0.259078	-0.031369	0.119959	-0.062836	-0.049831	-0.535346	0.035487	-0.108918	0.167515	0.945160	-0.024084	-2.102421	-0.025795	0.045811	1.260583	0.241976	-0.091502	0.952481	-0.356424	0.090126	0.613139	-0.001729	0.467168	0.258658	0.053153	-0.187245	0.080287	-0.126465	0.105597	-0.126866	0.222478	0.229981	-0.169303	-0.076258	-0.417661	0.068809	0.410615	-0.052152	-0.376903	-0.014500	-1.234877	-0.206732	0.057067	-0.188486	-0.302885	-0.215194	-0.034617	-0.036231	-0.009301	-0.194604	-0.404502	-0.238667	-0.306374	-0.303967	0.424645	0.279692
toy	"This is a perfect puzzle for my 2.5 and 4.5 year old daughters.  Puzzles with a few animals are much easier to work with than the ones with one big animal.  That, coupled with the colorful images are enough to keep them fully engaged.  My 2 year old can work on it by herself, but at some point she needs help in completing it.  We are moving soon, and this is definitely one of the puzzles we will keep.  Others, we will give away.My wife and I are very satisfied with this product and recommend it."	2	-0.078362	0.327392	0.234878	-0.131847	-0.043847	0.141846	-0.008076	0.176314	0.008693	-0.042107	0.191176	0.026004	0.148618	-0.036160	0.109756	-0.152939	0.121087	0.234396	-0.285056	0.318702	0.146703	-0.003008	0.126282	0.033942	0.265208	-0.036952	-0.219768	-0.434483	-0.010236	-0.039125	-0.164794	0.364814	-0.043488	-0.130497	-0.017665	0.163490	-0.054870	0.043850	-0.047001	-0.150582	-0.207870	-0.261310	0.172164	-0.378133	-0.142330	-0.014651	0.023489	-0.212744	-0.001468	-0.577550	0.042841	-0.263842	0.139900	1.015166	-0.071945	-2.071028	-0.014549	-0.201841	1.323271	0.364677	-0.108007	0.737486	-0.273696	0.082629	0.643382	0.129383	0.317341	0.343687	0.168713	-0.167132	0.060768	-0.075521	-0.010017	-0.153897	0.185198	0.150819	-0.147041	-0.088777	-0.588821	-0.073041	0.381849	0.049129	-0.491841	0.096720	-1.255574	-0.144042	0.061671	-0.047022	-0.286585	-0.204083	-0.064825	-0.046471	0.058993	-0.156779	-0.522237	-0.150107	-0.291113	-0.272810	0.432852	0.134515
toy	"This floor puzzle is a nice size - not huge, but larger than normal kid puzzles.  The pieces are thick and lock together well, even on carpet.  It seemed to be medium difficulty in that the connectors and pieces are all shaped very similarly.  Without too much forcing, you can get a piece to lock into the wrong spot.  It will have a gap, but since the pieces are so similarly shaped, it makes this possible.  That's the only downside I could find.The pieces are cardboard, but are very dense, almost like wood, but not quite that solid.  They don't have too much curl from the cutting process, so it all lays nice and flat.  My son put it together on berber carpet without having any issues with pieces not staying together.The storage box is ok- kind of thin cardboard."	2	-0.291300	0.437463	0.177972	-0.077082	0.007597	0.113632	-0.064312	0.109108	0.013973	-0.025720	0.130312	0.009332	0.153078	0.084371	0.099319	-0.077172	-0.030074	0.122152	0.067015	-0.062612	0.139172	0.121643	0.099256	-0.257917	0.337819	-0.044902	-0.189997	-0.296311	-0.114240	-0.114368	0.016660	0.161101	-0.033304	-0.163987	0.153382	0.163391	0.084514	0.098433	0.082370	-0.213227	-0.068515	-0.372454	0.051871	-0.312357	-0.223284	-0.041465	0.066599	0.069769	-0.089088	-0.504896	0.053843	-0.068854	0.100245	0.847903	-0.082078	-1.868757	-0.064227	-0.037539	1.235233	0.321851	-0.082851	0.820077	-0.249737	0.220319	0.540959	-0.096373	0.442124	0.205082	0.041711	-0.289565	0.029759	-0.022785	0.170670	-0.087963	0.207328	0.096358	-0.125740	-0.001546	-0.176382	0.188035	0.337722	-0.004542	-0.406245	0.062032	-1.032743	-0.198226	0.129813	-0.153052	-0.250951	-0.101109	-0.051813	-0.047017	-0.060026	-0.093717	-0.294147	-0.188290	-0.203029	-0.269932	0.492610	0.147611
toy	"This is a lovely puzzle. The image is fun and the pieces go together very well. The size is just right for little hands too! The box is great too - I opened the top flap and my daughter had fun putting the pieces away. The rope handle makes it easy for her to lug it around too.However, it's lower quality and more expensive than other brands such as Ravensburger. It's going to get beat up faster - the pieces were easily bent and just in shipping some of the pointier corners were bumped up."	2	-0.183381	0.291703	0.265698	-0.205094	-0.030073	0.173038	-0.135325	0.069475	0.019156	-0.060386	0.250457	0.021143	0.089526	0.064541	0.048282	-0.078268	-0.060072	0.213576	-0.105985	0.120622	0.288835	0.243219	0.133050	-0.191624	0.336928	0.083553	-0.319667	-0.339397	0.056354	-0.175522	-0.016975	0.277628	0.045402	-0.125597	0.166654	0.168947	-0.112266	0.072894	0.012166	-0.254584	-0.034010	-0.370240	-0.027455	-0.342335	-0.263317	-0.002080	0.057298	-0.022432	0.113017	-0.507101	0.033056	-0.019145	0.025469	0.883186	-0.060254	-1.854393	-0.094915	0.164732	1.247024	0.210537	-0.002925	0.827125	-0.273880	0.310518	0.383737	-0.109731	0.366401	0.234442	0.154770	-0.205518	0.023598	-0.073488	0.139594	-0.112475	0.191146	0.099015	-0.226433	-0.034189	-0.146847	0.071630	0.352336	0.033451	-0.367488	0.063857	-1.063811	-0.238081	-0.000199	-0.102584	-0.275351	-0.149460	-0.106729	0.027061	0.014916	-0.130079	-0.405153	-0.239096	-0.199898	-0.225769	0.562581	0.212989
toy	"My daughter is still at the age where everything goes into her mouth, so let me start by saying that while the cardboard pieces are sturdy and well made, they are not drool proof. The puzzle consists of five rows and five columns, making for 25 easy to assemble pieces. The colors are vibrant and the picture is as cute in person as you would expect from the box. We (I) put the puzzle together on the carpet, and the pieces locked fine. I would expect that once Fiona gets old enough to do it herself, it will be much easier for her to assemble on a hard surface.My one criticism is very superficial. The box is about twice as big as it needs to be. You may be wondering why that matters.... It is amazing how much stuff a tiny little baby accumulates. And as the tiny little baby grows, the aount of stuff grows as well. Exponentially. When the box, granted the very nice box, is twice as large as it needs to be, it means it takes up twice as much room as necessary as well."	2	-0.189028	0.428484	0.316057	-0.201861	-0.045531	0.255912	-0.099757	0.166044	0.055975	-0.093726	0.172914	0.043813	0.134907	0.124264	0.068919	-0.104080	0.022294	0.226911	-0.033691	0.174591	0.107429	0.123698	0.021106	-0.211176	0.268984	0.009539	-0.194804	-0.391004	-0.004186	-0.144477	-0.005987	0.300202	0.054248	-0.107575	0.174540	0.250497	-0.067700	0.096029	0.012785	-0.221380	-0.130606	-0.288251	0.059241	-0.390146	-0.165861	-0.091821	0.045322	-0.078906	0.034859	-0.532380	0.085220	-0.175011	0.120853	0.901375	-0.067902	-1.878399	-0.062744	-0.004223	1.195014	0.306324	-0.038329	0.851214	-0.311805	0.153353	0.566169	0.000117	0.430078	0.197338	0.019340	-0.223497	0.133536	-0.073834	0.079341	-0.110198	0.253638	0.213110	-0.201597	-0.112146	-0.317474	0.086151	0.384072	0.017804	-0.363657	0.028749	-1.058180	-0.262522	0.149004	-0.113461	-0.277199	-0.169650	0.012435	-0.013874	0.034066	-0.129906	-0.390017	-0.116028	-0.209734	-0.257993	0.420167	0.213072
toy	"This is a great puzzle for young children. The pieces are thick and large and that makes it easy for little hands to handle. (the pieces are roughly 4.5 x 5.5 inches to 4.5 x7 inches) The pieces lock into place easily. The sturdiness of the pieces will help this puzzle last through many assemblies and disassemblies.  The colors are crisp and bright and there is a nice variety of colors to help young children find the right pieces.While this may seem unimportant, I like that (unlike most puzzles) the box opens at the top and it also has a nice rope carry handle.And, finally, the picture is really cute."	2	-0.228797	0.464829	0.177635	-0.164396	0.086733	0.243754	0.071385	0.109585	-0.068149	-0.102031	0.272878	-0.114431	0.125856	0.148605	0.178439	-0.025930	0.091362	0.202972	-0.204618	0.176496	0.135929	-0.009080	0.191967	-0.149833	0.403623	0.006630	-0.127973	-0.268218	-0.039157	-0.133371	-0.028784	0.245713	-0.076845	-0.180502	0.048947	0.148605	0.024730	0.167328	0.053459	-0.118320	0.009154	-0.455995	-0.008347	-0.410894	-0.219615	-0.075688	-0.002865	-0.106267	0.040372	-0.380407	-0.010390	-0.158600	0.060798	0.919676	-0.103158	-1.921813	-0.058554	-0.075112	1.232871	0.336521	-0.190164	0.936357	-0.326413	0.216074	0.538615	-0.049945	0.244752	0.269814	0.136694	-0.227714	0.019495	-0.091980	0.062218	0.009399	0.264769	0.162069	-0.173930	0.052029	-0.236154	-0.039354	0.378372	-0.037482	-0.405981	0.007952	-1.027300	-0.276124	0.045690	-0.060072	-0.127230	-0.025816	-0.044740	0.076738	-0.020741	-0.125518	-0.583795	-0.098787	-0.369527	-0.338408	0.451439	0.084996
toy	I have reviewed Ravensburger puzzles in the past and this puzzle seem even more high quality.My nephew loves these at the time of this writing he's only 2 1/2 years old but he still combating these puzzles out and I think this is great for his abilities to problem solve in the future. So it says 3+ on the box but my nephews of building them since he was just over two.The pieces are high-quality made from sturdy cardboard and there's deftly no choking hazard as they are really extra large pieces. And the prices really decent nice puzzle for 15 bucks (at the time of writing this review). Another thing I like about this is the back of the puzzle is a white surface so after they've done this puzzle for a while and maybe are getting bored with it you can put together white side up and then draw together on it and then let the child put that puzzle that they made together just an idea but deftly could be fun for the whole family. You could even draw a map to their birthday or Christmas presents on the puzzle pieces that have them find the puzzle pieces to build the map find where their presence are located (that which is me brainstorming out but that would be fun also)Here's a few things that you can do to introduce the puzzle and get more out of it. I think putting it together 1st so the child gets the picture and then start disassembling it a piece of the time will help engage even young children and helping them to get the concepts of puzzles. another thing you could do is put the puzzle together upside down have them flip each piece over and then start putting each piece they flip over together again another little way to help them get engaged and understand the concepts of puzzles.To me I personally feel that helping children understand puzzles and how to put pieces together is one of the best early learning tools you can offer them.	2	-0.109641	0.368107	0.202657	-0.110930	-0.027074	0.180453	-0.033848	0.023679	0.026278	-0.049086	0.163061	-0.027094	0.101850	0.002730	-0.004289	-0.066290	0.068714	0.228057	-0.282657	0.164163	0.107805	0.024261	0.107236	-0.238201	0.226630	-0.095056	-0.207320	-0.313568	-0.062720	-0.142325	-0.179135	0.344504	-0.053603	-0.071675	0.047689	0.132108	-0.095906	0.117639	0.050214	-0.246650	-0.262736	-0.139947	0.020224	-0.407098	-0.316858	0.045342	0.000855	-0.146312	-0.030941	-0.541235	0.018560	-0.143405	0.050837	0.933457	-0.029779	-1.999917	-0.039001	-0.071041	1.138805	0.403422	-0.148330	0.860341	-0.312611	0.032003	0.577759	0.004110	0.370491	0.341600	0.054922	-0.192431	0.091655	-0.081678	0.030210	-0.187620	0.140851	0.184334	-0.175400	-0.009242	-0.433118	0.049368	0.360927	0.082058	-0.372423	0.014046	-1.203802	-0.108384	0.009806	-0.112917	-0.363467	-0.240360	-0.131165	-0.013548	0.001051	-0.173322	-0.383571	-0.194603	-0.206447	-0.279869	0.448857	0.245134
toy	"This is a sturdy and easy to put together puzzle. 24pcs. Cardboard. Really cute illustrations. I love the big pieces and think the best educational value is for the dexterity a young child can learn putting puzzles pieces together. My kids found this an easy puzzle, just because of the big pieces. My 2 yr old nephew found it a bit more challenging, but with help enjoyed the outcome. The box can easily double as a storage box for the pieces and it has a carrying handle for little hands. My 7-10yr olds liked putting it together and did so a couple of times before they got bored. My 2 yr old nephew enjoys putting this together over and over again (probably because of not only the challenge, but the time spent with older folks who ""help"" him) :)"	2	-0.090192	0.406784	0.242716	-0.170730	-0.020022	0.259691	-0.030654	0.001978	-0.076630	-0.061548	0.221242	-0.012559	0.077579	0.028199	0.057900	-0.084325	0.107266	0.190973	-0.216126	0.288159	0.122726	0.168067	0.117305	-0.206221	0.260274	-0.087945	-0.213924	-0.379387	-0.019547	-0.040367	-0.088207	0.336956	0.032471	-0.160896	0.155500	0.117065	-0.081432	0.112942	0.120397	-0.205437	-0.119896	-0.231371	0.089298	-0.418589	-0.287861	-0.039199	-0.031895	-0.133010	-0.010241	-0.497258	-0.033604	-0.179040	0.087564	0.877285	0.053434	-1.889619	-0.078040	-0.008033	1.066924	0.322316	-0.087847	0.841142	-0.292279	0.107407	0.453004	-0.011822	0.430839	0.306358	0.035052	-0.132372	0.063413	0.037937	0.068595	-0.088301	0.094235	0.279765	-0.204265	-0.040376	-0.318825	-0.016701	0.350031	0.101858	-0.283385	-0.003323	-1.143312	-0.199762	-0.018332	-0.148689	-0.445284	-0.209056	-0.052314	-0.011619	0.138316	-0.211941	-0.455271	-0.243356	-0.301703	-0.312514	0.414278	0.184258
toy	"This puzzle is very attractive for kids, at least for those with whom I've used it.  It features a number of different animals, all presented in a very cute manner.  The colors are quite bright, and the puzzle makes little ones think without being so challenging as to push them away from using it.My only issue lies with the quality of the puzzle pieces, which don't lock together as securely as I would have expected given the price.  I do like the sturdy box, and the drawstring makes it easy to carry around.  As someone who has seen many puzzle boxes fall apart over the years leading to a mess of different puzzles stored in the wrong boxes, this is much appreciated.I would recommend this for any parent of a young child, there aren't many kids who wouldn't enjoy this one."	2	-0.159188	0.423530	0.273424	-0.198310	-0.047807	0.197237	-0.082617	0.078443	0.029175	-0.085104	0.126105	0.030368	0.217279	0.012893	0.112518	-0.120677	0.049767	0.238383	-0.174427	0.192014	0.160955	0.020643	0.122671	-0.255979	0.185741	-0.089341	-0.139555	-0.344065	-0.122727	-0.093590	0.054463	0.329131	-0.049878	-0.133483	0.219565	0.259977	-0.046128	0.083002	0.005305	-0.326526	-0.144642	-0.177754	0.017886	-0.378234	-0.272212	-0.010594	0.099598	-0.081866	-0.107182	-0.600383	0.109441	-0.141252	0.091175	0.909565	-0.032931	-1.890027	0.000186	-0.048465	1.296780	0.289325	-0.125176	0.907948	-0.273068	0.123176	0.615102	0.018002	0.428192	0.245131	0.137200	-0.224681	0.037097	-0.136546	0.099820	-0.122874	0.191469	0.160566	-0.121817	-0.035687	-0.427923	-0.003466	0.374776	-0.043136	-0.408248	-0.037644	-1.216227	-0.183982	0.033734	-0.188310	-0.315219	-0.181023	-0.088727	0.030471	0.019982	-0.185614	-0.444851	-0.130689	-0.352071	-0.303259	0.501504	0.240694
toy	"My little girl (almost 3) is really into animals right now and had a lot of fun doing this puzzle with me. She's still too young to really grasp how to put the pieces together, but we named the animals as we put them together and she tried to put pieces together. It is a nice size; big but not too big to have to crawl over it to reach where the pieces have to go."	2	-0.116995	0.410360	0.249868	-0.286850	-0.103525	0.322634	-0.021725	0.052589	0.010431	-0.234003	0.244520	0.096374	0.188999	0.065560	0.004662	-0.015092	-0.001726	0.393086	-0.352087	0.311118	0.316470	0.262256	0.073733	-0.353352	0.299418	0.038955	-0.370800	-0.459574	0.085409	-0.142237	-0.172603	0.338240	0.105622	-0.104033	0.108509	0.132785	-0.099627	0.198887	0.083368	-0.250976	-0.134748	-0.231995	0.009173	-0.455391	-0.364601	0.006167	-0.096737	0.029205	-0.024399	-0.600590	-0.007418	-0.113784	0.076444	0.940877	-0.022115	-2.162122	-0.114681	0.049974	1.223627	0.429233	0.065143	1.103943	-0.499391	0.126617	0.653218	0.087105	0.432701	0.341032	0.055725	-0.228188	0.149035	-0.089195	0.035345	-0.213548	0.131194	0.241892	-0.272360	-0.128610	-0.203721	0.073513	0.349016	0.147151	-0.348711	0.073828	-1.251298	-0.258382	0.022969	-0.034193	-0.406917	-0.144758	-0.025417	-0.134129	0.086014	-0.189903	-0.486548	-0.206318	-0.418771	-0.249618	0.417381	0.274610
toy	"Mudpuppy at the Zoo is a brightly colored attractive puzzle to engage young minds.  Puzzles are great for motor skills and problem solving, especially for young minds.My 2 1/2 year old niece loves puzzles, so Mudpuppy at the Zoo was an instant hit.  She is drawn to the cute animals and bright colors.  She still has trouble picking out how the picture goes together, but the shape of the puzzle pieces helps her to solve it.  She needs some help with the puzzle, so a 2 year age recommendation may not work in all cases.  But she learns teamwork and problem-solving skills.The pieces are a little thicker than traditional pieces, easier for smaller hands to grip and piece together.  Although it is still cardboard, the extra thickness makes it more durable.  The construction of the pieces is great and should last repeated puzzling, even with a toddler.  I would caution putting the puzzle together on softer surfaces like carpet or padded tables, the pieces are more likely to bend faster.  I especially like that it is made from recycled paper and nontoxic soy-based inks.I recommend this puzzle and this company to toddlers, or those who would supply them with puzzles.  Highly enjoyable!"	2	-0.157208	0.440373	0.211080	-0.095059	-0.038008	0.076031	-0.009941	-0.001453	0.058133	-0.032175	0.051119	-0.105209	0.165034	0.010648	0.059307	-0.034786	0.074421	0.169229	-0.042066	0.069689	0.083923	0.001919	0.060433	-0.139903	0.252597	-0.029425	-0.171908	-0.295195	-0.176123	-0.070097	-0.126438	0.234300	-0.137331	-0.171245	0.069076	0.191386	0.000608	0.097001	0.030765	-0.287536	-0.119336	-0.199347	-0.018075	-0.370711	-0.298955	0.034769	0.010729	-0.050940	-0.034623	-0.480961	0.006484	-0.157333	0.040410	0.878629	-0.036840	-1.578675	-0.040249	-0.062450	1.041641	0.247166	-0.130420	0.795893	-0.231161	0.146058	0.483836	0.041946	0.312225	0.186916	0.106172	-0.239482	0.074813	-0.035412	0.047774	-0.033135	0.204184	0.182334	-0.163875	0.004724	-0.335001	0.016733	0.352294	0.057997	-0.366846	0.061374	-1.073236	-0.121031	-0.007502	-0.106731	-0.290317	-0.122722	-0.054809	-0.019197	-0.022771	-0.122822	-0.314152	-0.135228	-0.346827	-0.318899	0.469565	0.213953

grocery	"I bought this on impulse and it comes from Japan,  which amused my family,  all those weird stamps and markings on the package. So that was fun.  It said it would take about a month to arrive and it did take that long.  I was hoping for a more interesting taste but to our family,  it just tasted a bit less flavorful or weaker than the standard milk chocolate kit kat.  The green tea flavor was too subtle for the sugar and it just tasted sweet. The wafers were very crispy, and that was good,  but it tasted a bit anemic to us.I'm happy I bought it, but don't need to buy it again."	3	-0.176548	0.328451	0.271998	-0.185004	-0.227858	0.013617	0.059664	0.100931	0.029041	-0.126547	0.026342	-0.033389	0.101609	0.084468	0.146618	-0.075568	0.032864	0.008164	-0.014094	0.260041	0.228524	0.150709	-0.046685	-0.230019	0.065384	0.304055	-0.130211	-0.342730	-0.067797	-0.112779	-0.055356	0.468506	-0.071450	-0.208274	0.182299	0.418396	0.004829	0.192900	0.032994	-0.376465	-0.017449	-0.483950	0.007768	-0.404132	-0.123385	-0.005735	0.087992	-0.066564	0.172293	-0.779969	0.046498	-0.162583	0.148411	0.645309	-0.296482	-1.559144	-0.102962	0.088611	0.941001	0.031147	0.123342	0.710535	-0.310560	0.036454	0.340786	-0.214401	0.253281	0.156296	0.049870	-0.371016	0.065649	-0.136059	-0.008402	-0.085137	0.109790	0.373026	-0.235395	-0.207732	-0.475644	0.072505	0.201388	-0.196329	-0.371833	0.209601	-0.886136	-0.230412	0.136581	-0.038754	-0.276186	-0.187382	-0.002229	0.032752	-0.052450	-0.183199	-0.526677	-0.117498	-0.229123	-0.236066	0.322245	0.238176

grocery	"I've been looking forward to trying these after hearing about how popular they were in Japan, and among Kit Kat fans as well. I do not recommend ordering these during warm weather, because they can melt and become smushy. I ordered mine right when summer began, and they were a bit mushy so I let them solidify under room temp. Afterwards, I tried some and they tasted fine. I was expecting a stronger green tea or matcha flavor, but it is actually quite subtle. The outer coating was creamy and not overly sugary, which I liked. Overall, I wouldn't say it's insanely good, but definitely a yummy treat."	3	-0.193692	0.210525	0.158694	-0.113208	-0.214712	0.053241	-0.065654	0.085209	-0.033363	-0.055333	0.061881	-0.106456	0.175491	-0.000262	0.127827	-0.137711	-0.011895	-0.061063	-0.077714	0.181657	0.156580	0.165993	0.034824	-0.215913	-0.062029	0.263263	-0.158625	-0.369263	0.053113	-0.125694	-0.050631	0.327528	-0.025853	-0.084426	0.131523	0.291401	-0.033467	0.070130	0.042870	-0.214417	-0.125772	-0.301363	0.042554	-0.346345	-0.054324	-0.055289	0.095888	0.002904	0.211964	-0.680894	0.111140	-0.136988	-0.002858	0.682598	-0.189180	-1.494951	0.101039	0.091282	0.900801	0.172638	-0.083017	0.664666	-0.261511	0.142323	0.462527	-0.043433	0.360451	0.119989	-0.022011	-0.339218	0.107697	-0.170900	0.029642	-0.058674	0.037448	0.230712	-0.167637	-0.116313	-0.189475	0.007414	0.260595	-0.139624	-0.428204	0.076717	-0.910447	-0.242261	0.142873	0.068125	-0.316060	-0.161895	0.097806	-0.100967	-0.142749	-0.110481	-0.256330	-0.075684	-0.310192	-0.154904	0.216749	0.235491

These are the best Kit Kats I've ever had, and I would recommend them to anyone who likes matcha-flavored candies or anyone wanting to try an unusual kind of Kit Kat."	3	-0.185631	0.261407	0.206590	-0.175829	-0.185827	0.221848	0.014968	0.055180	0.000962	-0.042597	0.063775	-0.093164	0.064233	0.057770	0.085758	-0.081504	0.118694	0.063812	-0.147783	0.345717	-0.028402	0.120817	-0.045666	-0.271336	-0.123666	0.319325	-0.046003	-0.342333	-0.051044	-0.093749	-0.019988	0.366823	-0.079646	-0.105013	0.181405	0.230314	0.015581	0.199494	0.046662	-0.325775	-0.134354	-0.311155	0.040170	-0.378849	-0.165188	0.068828	0.031215	-0.149585	0.194123	-0.732803	0.073688	-0.005223	0.012044	0.676926	-0.168583	-1.389431	0.030957	0.082875	0.848270	0.120114	-0.007163	0.667704	-0.224120	0.115811	0.416178	-0.162669	0.404652	0.249977	-0.079888	-0.331763	0.030026	-0.165347	-0.075283	-0.158071	0.040844	0.366852	-0.242320	-0.129661	-0.361820	-0.014976	0.221694	-0.175644	-0.327180	0.027728	-0.968276	-0.152594	0.067076	0.038466	-0.184085	-0.039385	-0.057707	-0.056861	-0.118670	-0.117006	-0.268087	-0.097530	-0.403511	-0.172256	0.288843	0.227064

grocery	"I have two things in mind when I make a Thai curry: 1) I want it to taste good and 2) I want whomever I'm making it for to feel like it's fairly authentic. Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with ""lite"" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer. (FYI,If you live in an area where there are asian markets, you will do better buying it there as it will be even cheaper)."	3	-0.227515	0.288599	0.222129	-0.220204	-0.138705	0.065301	-0.018013	0.045383	0.090190	-0.030185	0.030762	-0.042685	0.169171	0.114103	0.043473	-0.088283	0.081441	0.096924	-0.167094	0.285841	0.116442	0.161893	0.040242	-0.205024	0.044892	0.188646	-0.079025	-0.407044	-0.125006	-0.152561	-0.080691	0.509092	-0.072568	-0.153284	0.203055	0.315059	0.001667	0.195667	0.030864	-0.336577	-0.113134	-0.417081	0.034268	-0.369876	-0.116741	0.032889	-0.006014	-0.129592	-0.026960	-0.773315	-0.016429	-0.061354	-0.006738	0.844258	-0.181990	-1.723397	-0.062584	-0.019460	1.222933	0.183792	-0.126237	0.670589	-0.197411	0.113221	0.540230	-0.093223	0.415829	0.053666	0.026246	-0.304863	-0.055075	-0.077273	0.112370	-0.042194	0.119755	0.235658	-0.150884	-0.097972	-0.368422	0.104841	0.398942	-0.111286	-0.547151	0.075409	-1.029058	-0.195280	0.090787	-0.061795	-0.271611	-0.178986	-0.016637	0.014485	-0.056075	-0.231848	-0.440133	-0.142329	-0.179404	-0.298875	0.389150	0.340577

grocery	"My only complaint about this product is that sometimes it is difficult to squeeze just a very small amount from the bottle into the mixture to be colored.  I don't do massive amounts of baking, and I find that sometimes it is really hard to get a very light color when adding this product to very small quantities of mixture.  However, the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.  I thought this product was a little pricy, but after trying it out, I do believe that it was worth the extra money.  The product seems of high quality and it shows in my cooking whenever I want to add some color to things."	3	-0.296732	0.449647	0.104598	-0.113900	-0.048803	0.199150	-0.024761	0.150174	0.078482	0.050947	0.022627	-0.135956	0.153615	0.021797	0.036038	-0.108347	0.009082	0.137966	0.033724	0.104366	0.041135	0.041376	0.010174	-0.270878	0.010856	0.174891	0.011976	-0.297337	-0.197014	-0.224686	0.076620	0.438561	-0.217983	-0.221572	0.130533	0.185736	0.064688	0.106306	0.036690	-0.237423	-0.100771	-0.530261	-0.175777	-0.369233	-0.168343	-0.046586	0.016491	-0.092454	-0.033982	-0.743575	0.208128	-0.046061	0.068654	0.866013	-0.056914	-1.844437	-0.034814	-0.000555	1.304442	0.146792	0.001261	0.739125	-0.281584	0.091462	0.728135	-0.170472	0.502550	-0.106245	0.147983	-0.317202	0.104967	-0.083552	0.072681	0.022552	0.315499	0.336099	-0.138507	-0.226199	-0.322781	0.146799	0.411778	-0.053682	-0.550740	0.001356	-1.064646	-0.260076	0.139606	-0.145253	-0.217216	-0.145696	-0.123792	-0.029146	-0.209264	-0.307881	-0.439872	-0.190041	-0.302309	-0.252670	0.429959	0.261471

They fill me up better than other bars on the market and I am a big fan of the taste.  I do eat alot of different meal and energy bars over the course of the week but I think these are my favorite.

grocery	"I have to watch what I eat as I am diabetic.  As a result I can experience low blood sugars especially when I do a lot of yard work, exercise a lot or ride my bike.  I always carry one of these with me as an emergency booster to make sure that I have the energy to continue or to raise my blood sugar when I need it.We tried many types of energy bars and to me so many tasted like cardboard.  If it doesn't taste good then why eat it?  To me this is the best energy bar that I have tried and I like that it is helping me while I enjoy eating it.  They do contain a lot of calories and sugar so I only use them when I really need to have the boost.  I also carried them when I used to travel all of the time and I got off schedule with my meals because of time zones and long flights.Nutrition data for the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor:* Calories 250* Calories from fat* Total fat 5 grams* Saturated fat 2 grams* Trans fat 0* Cholesterol 0* Sodium 140 mg* Potassium 200 mg* Total carbohydrates 43 grams* Dietary fiber 5 grams* Sugars 22 grams* Protein 10 grams* It also includes Vitamins C and B6, calcium, iron thiamin and riboflavin.* I wish that foods sold online always posted the nutrition labels and the ingredients so you could check for allergies and sugars.The only down side for me is that if I am bike riding for example and it gets hot then the icing coating on the bottom gets soft and can be messy so I just eat them out of the wrapper.  I still like them and I use them all the time when I need the boost.  This is a good product and I recommend it."	3	-0.223016	0.303727	0.124773	-0.221551	-0.114529	0.026871	-0.020514	0.188235	-0.204372	-0.042358	0.216213	-0.098955	0.044370	0.127316	0.162779	-0.011568	0.029777	0.035322	-0.113942	0.210026	0.211854	0.147741	-0.003454	-0.059801	-0.110876	0.342740	-0.052169	-0.299647	-0.081730	-0.028352	0.089751	0.493451	-0.134560	-0.221167	0.082799	0.338365	0.089347	0.329772	-0.096544	-0.015672	0.056939	-0.482244	-0.027651	-0.566612	-0.098184	0.070958	-0.120502	-0.274156	-0.152316	-0.528382	0.074347	-0.116074	-0.096183	0.790676	-0.234675	-1.409499	-0.146866	-0.068914	1.221282	0.134581	-0.025314	0.484682	-0.109480	0.022236	0.549605	0.098265	0.335322	-0.096426	0.309615	-0.381061	-0.020702	-0.301190	0.318755	0.241605	0.101683	0.162654	-0.042746	-0.239866	-0.411097	-0.014336	0.262843	-0.162342	-0.594547	0.191616	-0.966805	-0.105439	0.212244	-0.086766	-0.392581	-0.018852	-0.088400	-0.022448	-0.086569	-0.181104	-0.546655	-0.294608	-0.042376	-0.509558	0.460002	0.178586
grocery	"I make no claims to sports nutrition (or any nutrition for that matter)expertise, so I'll just call it a snack, and leave its place in your exercise program between you and your personal doctor/nutritionist/coach/guru. However, I will say that this is a much better than average tasting sports bar/snack (name your preference), free of the cardboad-ish and stale texture and barely identifiable aftertastes common to similar products.While noone will compare this to a real apple crisp, this convenient food for those on the go has recognizable tastes of oats (this flavor and texture predominates), apple, and cinnamon, due in large part, I suspect, to the fact that it actually contains those ingredients! There are also raisins, cane and other sugars--including fructose from fruit juices-- giving it a sweet but not cloying (as they say at the wineries) taste. This company is known for its quality ingredients and generally consumer-friendly face; you can read more about them at powerbar.com. The company recommends consuming this with water to aid the absorption of the many added nutrients--this also gives one a more ""full"" feeling. One of the better tasting snacks of this type; I've listed nutritional information and ingredients (from the web site) below.Nutritional Information:*Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.In one Serving Size (One Bar; total=65 grams), there are 240 calories and 35 calories from fat 35 (6% of DV).

grocery	"This was actually a really good bar.  I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast.  I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.  So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack.  It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast.  It kept me full and I liked the taste, and it will have inspired me to try other PowerBar flavors as well.Review by M.

grocery	"If you are a fan of peanut butter and chocolate, than this bar is for you.  I've tried a number of energy bars and they all suffer from one problem -- bland taste and usually end up leaving a gritty aftertaste in my mouth.  Not so with PowerBar.I make a PowerBar part of my regular morning routine.  After trying a few of the other flavors I finally stumbled upon the peanut butter and chocolate chip and was ""hooked"".  The flavor is just right and the crispness of the bar is not too hard, but firm enough to make you ""feel"" like you are eating a full meal.  One bar will usually kill any cravings I have all throughout the morning."	3	-0.140107	0.249559	0.128800	-0.158272	-0.210883	0.244110	0.028766	0.147725	0.054558	-0.086537	0.006737	-0.105195	0.210462	0.167553	0.056409	0.008367	-0.020212	-0.035199	-0.193030	0.104339	0.205300	0.164395	0.052531	-0.279491	0.140150	0.347733	-0.157887	-0.392650	0.038357	-0.212017	-0.020560	0.434862	0.014582	-0.110460	0.069072	0.275407	-0.015923	0.206126	0.094810	-0.332736	-0.055373	-0.406257	-0.018635	-0.435271	-0.094983	0.075645	-0.003252	-0.099033	0.098534	-0.661345	0.019791	-0.126973	-0.094317	0.819115	-0.189542	-1.609661	-0.011246	0.007939	1.177649	0.283920	0.010225	0.650175	-0.159158	0.016041	0.511028	-0.118049	0.483137	0.054778	-0.006687	-0.325943	-0.125485	-0.091469	0.142211	-0.023245	0.000038	0.234489	-0.164012	-0.291807	-0.246708	0.073046	0.337607	-0.146432	-0.495418	0.195079	-0.959089	-0.265641	0.123596	-0.011951	-0.210939	-0.194701	-0.026080	0.048486	-0.176932	-0.011765	-0.488794	-0.133507	-0.121447	-0.183877	0.419166	0.224958

grocery	"I don't know about the medicinal aspects of this tea, but the flavor is downright scrumptious.  I love licorice root but have high blood pressure, so I'm not guzzling down box after box each week.  A few cups a week doesn't touch my BP, so I keep it to that.  The directions say to steep it for 10-15 minutes, but I'm far too impatient for that.  4-6 minutes is all I can wait after smelling that lovely aroma.  Traditional Medicinals puts out some really good teas.  I just wish they weren't so proud of 'em.  ChaChing!  Thanks, TM. Now try to work on that pricing for us, will ya?

grocery	"Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried. I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them. I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent. My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy. Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing. I don't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm. I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care."	3	-0.226151	0.333518	0.241962	-0.100022	-0.229543	0.365137	-0.016475	-0.026308	-0.011631	-0.215460	-0.230856	-0.057396	0.124252	0.103175	0.015301	-0.068245	-0.004814	0.007848	-0.214314	0.199715	0.082899	0.185104	-0.018535	-0.201326	-0.042841	0.406891	-0.217444	-0.363004	0.006286	-0.110849	-0.083252	0.394381	-0.022599	-0.120454	0.108333	0.332342	-0.058032	0.206664	0.161635	-0.309948	-0.086534	-0.224448	0.006315	-0.474269	-0.076581	0.056957	0.023853	0.035969	0.098231	-0.708389	-0.109082	0.043156	0.014373	0.618664	-0.069275	-1.411175	0.111840	0.110323	0.824882	0.047981	0.109326	0.653823	-0.220796	0.039341	0.318410	-0.031829	0.497853	-0.176524	0.059180	-0.513256	-0.030371	-0.222822	0.034444	-0.043764	0.056572	0.284061	-0.227586	-0.161398	-0.234347	-0.078779	0.216141	-0.042133	-0.431133	0.267101	-1.056954	-0.150143	0.056919	0.163307	-0.490022	-0.039141	0.167029	-0.107084	-0.016098	-0.190476	-0.340679	0.014009	-0.265172	-0.165365	0.206776	0.402966

grocery	"I love having one of these in my backpack or purse as a back-up pick-me up that isn't overloaded with sugar, sodium or artificial sweeteners. I'm deathly allergic to Splenda (secretly added to many things today under the chemical name of sucralose), so I always check labels. Most energy bars are not high enough in protein, or are either overly sweet, overly salty or worse - overly bland. I don't have the sensation that I'm eating cardboard covered in flavoring. Unlike a lot of protein bars out there, I really have a sensation of being full after having one, instead of trying to find something else to snack on. I'm one of those rare birds that hates chocolate, so it's hard enough to find an option that is not dripping in the brown stuff. Rest assured, chocolate lovers, PowerBar does make chocolate flavored bars - but I very much appreciate having the vanilla yogurt bar as an option for protein. It isn't overly crunchy, so I don't get flecks of particles all over my shirt when I grab one on the go - and I don't get stuff stuck between my teeth eating these, either - so it's safe to have before a staff meeting."	3	-0.099622	0.268604	0.243033	-0.223269	-0.179119	0.212242	-0.037941	0.068419	0.081298	-0.118440	0.136563	-0.020555	0.152006	0.129427	0.153886	-0.053520	-0.033556	0.084225	-0.024942	0.191540	0.099129	0.246495	-0.021168	-0.257949	0.064421	0.313944	-0.118642	-0.377012	-0.025670	-0.040815	0.086599	0.420387	-0.017152	-0.156108	0.135533	0.275109	0.001612	0.206927	0.023106	-0.264725	-0.041468	-0.344456	0.006340	-0.477544	-0.124610	-0.013048	-0.010345	0.001457	-0.060345	-0.657074	0.043308	-0.135216	0.050403	0.732425	-0.218680	-1.493994	-0.000915	0.054079	1.031485	0.177782	0.009131	0.691713	-0.227302	0.010111	0.482084	-0.104609	0.534241	0.100666	0.008549	-0.391775	-0.075590	-0.238251	0.188277	0.021530	0.047527	0.294677	-0.019322	-0.228238	-0.286266	0.032635	0.274094	-0.216545	-0.502445	0.178496	-0.944917	-0.172028	0.151016	0.000754	-0.330042	-0.169589	-0.049238	0.022062	-0.090692	-0.098614	-0.391631	-0.213280	-0.280866	-0.262337	0.335178	0.219518

grocery	"This is awesome.  It tastes like the fake marshmallows they put in immoral breakfast cereal, but instead of just tasting like sugar it tastes like fat as well.  I can't believe I never tried this stuff until now, but I am definitely going to keep a stack of these in my desk.Disclosure:1. Your block of ""ice cream"" WILL be broken into a bunch of smaller chunks.  It is so brittle that they probably all end up like that (this was the first one I ate, but one reason I passed on this stuff so many times is because I could tell by picking up the package that they were always broken).2. Partly for the above reason, astronauts don't actually eat this stuff any more.  Wikipedia says it was used on one mission and was found to be inconvenient.  Also, they have a freezer on the space station and just eat real ice cream.In spite of those facts, this stuff is delicious."	3	-0.189764	0.351458	0.310526	-0.282581	-0.163213	0.129197	0.033347	0.137551	0.081297	-0.098467	0.193928	0.001725	0.188814	0.208945	0.053096	-0.080194	0.128246	0.192257	-0.206009	0.208846	0.171589	0.177864	0.053925	-0.232696	0.144552	0.149463	-0.185647	-0.360144	-0.045355	-0.119307	0.050770	0.439621	-0.037842	-0.141033	0.080849	0.284488	-0.003853	0.133637	0.066119	-0.304734	-0.135120	-0.321819	-0.014348	-0.372542	-0.127954	-0.021673	0.020732	-0.165948	-0.044429	-0.598343	0.148346	-0.076285	0.067144	0.815103	-0.212384	-1.788196	-0.064361	0.070676	1.156416	0.348747	-0.075081	0.761040	-0.205119	0.011019	0.619287	-0.084619	0.445761	0.065400	0.078794	-0.294930	-0.032290	-0.159767	0.103581	-0.009172	0.041173	0.169990	-0.050512	-0.099734	-0.386521	0.118124	0.327829	-0.088942	-0.450740	0.131537	-1.037907	-0.272043	0.091688	-0.096669	-0.265330	-0.158076	-0.035224	-0.004403	-0.088304	-0.097015	-0.462177	-0.228014	-0.169676	-0.235973	0.444901	0.250922
grocery	"I bought these for a lightweight backpacking snack. From what I remembered as a kid they are very tasty, and I was not disappointed! I've read other reviews complain about they come broken apart - but that's normal/acceptable - it in no way effects the quality of this product. The packaging of this is bulky - almost 0.4oz per! Luckily this product stays fresh in just a ziplock bag for at least a week. I put most of these in a gallon ziplock and saved several ounces in weight over ditching the stock packaging material. Gave some to my son and he loved them as well - they make a great/unique gift to kids."	3	-0.054502	0.355082	0.240875	-0.227542	-0.138091	0.091022	0.085932	0.166874	-0.022680	-0.002511	0.185782	-0.071320	0.081083	-0.008095	0.141582	-0.119703	0.048863	0.141668	-0.137522	0.290778	0.243106	0.086481	0.027300	-0.090190	0.155667	0.129087	-0.194941	-0.301075	-0.049399	-0.068812	0.045450	0.388580	-0.100634	-0.066943	0.134347	0.276580	0.012911	0.174250	-0.066548	-0.300320	0.020838	-0.300676	0.075418	-0.351475	-0.118124	0.001573	-0.006403	-0.121013	-0.022516	-0.640017	0.155026	-0.074318	0.078073	0.701202	-0.145056	-1.593091	-0.065587	0.036967	1.185539	0.171139	0.050101	0.624705	-0.306679	0.079192	0.413849	-0.068534	0.368031	0.083036	0.149748	-0.274202	0.006053	-0.002940	0.166301	0.077129	0.101681	0.296286	-0.119324	-0.121336	-0.427016	0.001677	0.321899	-0.055002	-0.394257	0.025009	-1.021047	-0.188440	0.016040	-0.207096	-0.352182	-0.132301	0.021447	0.008828	0.033685	-0.158421	-0.498824	-0.088198	-0.164236	-0.156553	0.395530	0.184755

grocery	"I've been using ""Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 1"" for years with myBlack & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug, but I can no longer find them at any of my local stores. Luckily I found them by the case at Amazon for much less than what I was paying for them at the store. I now have enough filters to last me at least 2 years. These filters fit my 1 cup Black and Decker coffee maker perfectly, and do a much better job filtering the coffee than the permanent filter that comes with it. Another supposed benefit is that paper coffee filters trap oily substances in coffee called ""diterpenes"", which are said to raise your cholesterol levels, and are not filtered out if you use the permanent mesh filter.

grocery	"These filters fit nicely inside my individual-sized ceramic beverage strainer.  Placed atop a coffee mug or teacup, the filter enables me to make coffee, or tea, minus coffee grounds or tea leaves in the end product!  Simply place the ground coffee or loose tea inside the filter, and pour in boiling water to fill the mug/cup.  Alternatively, if are serving a group, coffee can be prepared in a percolator & loose tea in a teapot...then, poured through filters into individual cups to remove any grounds/tealeaves. I became unable to locate the smaller sizes of these filters (such as this #1) in local retail stores years ago--and was thrilled to discover that Amazon could supply them."	3	-0.288218	0.395623	-0.060065	-0.118020	-0.006934	0.289294	0.078510	0.194660	-0.008032	-0.045176	0.130548	-0.192322	0.077230	0.130821	-0.004592	-0.091657	0.228157	0.101218	-0.101382	-0.145442	0.004714	0.094126	0.267633	-0.096623	0.096357	0.102673	-0.017232	-0.234353	-0.141286	-0.160030	0.130668	0.307109	0.013816	-0.180232	0.167586	0.344041	0.043251	0.090510	-0.031672	-0.365706	-0.087936	-0.466714	-0.095260	-0.480933	0.194211	0.064227	-0.218178	-0.001099	0.008269	-0.562866	-0.001926	0.010516	-0.061520	0.773553	-0.213382	-1.407152	-0.177273	-0.018158	1.162250	0.186500	-0.128648	0.446615	-0.106678	0.271651	0.468069	-0.054754	0.347088	-0.071533	0.277171	-0.386842	-0.053603	0.012052	0.245537	-0.053696	0.075918	0.122631	-0.005837	-0.179320	-0.303389	0.187662	0.423774	-0.116018	-0.552377	0.156240	-0.589952	-0.241992	0.141439	-0.045210	-0.093670	-0.050005	-0.010361	0.066187	-0.111386	-0.160344	-0.379606	-0.196543	-0.122091	-0.101131	0.391891	0.267468

grocery	"Licorice is my favorite candy, and it promotes good digestion. Since I have some digestive issues, I eat licorice on a regular basis. I've tried basically every brand. I bought this because it's advertised as soft licorice. However, it is the same consistency as the cheapest stuff on the grocery store shelf; the difference is that this has a stronger flavor. The flavor is nice. The consistency and texture is terrible. I bought another package hoping the first was just old/stale, but the next package was the same.

grocery	"These soft licorice bites from Panda are not as soft as the &#34;soft-eating licorice&#34; from Down Under but are what I would describe as soft but chewy. They are truly &#34;all natural&#34; and have a minimum of ingredients&#8211;&#8211;molasses, wheat flour, licorice extract, and natural flavor (aniseed oil). Nothing more than that. They have a slightly grainy texture, which comes from the use of wheat flour. They also have a strong, traditional licorice taste, which make them ideal for a person with a craving for genuine licorice."	3	-0.186850	0.542166	0.079469	-0.112268	-0.011359	-0.056689	0.055067	-0.140826	0.029668	0.075437	-0.204627	-0.137396	0.268361	0.270357	0.222235	0.165992	-0.035841	-0.073199	0.025712	0.212460	0.007434	0.047540	0.028837	-0.207451	-0.058677	0.595391	-0.107701	-0.244024	-0.176614	-0.071626	-0.027280	0.285401	-0.160000	-0.328350	0.039074	0.236365	0.086434	0.305705	0.076165	-0.257805	0.043139	-0.554351	-0.100815	-0.280446	-0.043112	0.036685	0.062624	-0.102319	-0.046666	-0.596268	-0.040426	-0.011597	0.088255	0.730027	-0.117245	-1.128191	0.034258	0.029739	0.937778	-0.014841	0.147560	0.499880	-0.163852	-0.069952	0.476571	-0.282632	0.435701	-0.263160	0.106682	-0.630188	-0.143688	-0.108754	0.113406	0.181535	0.188930	0.139649	-0.198299	-0.325165	-0.371198	0.249578	0.212020	-0.265603	-0.589097	0.344556	-0.729105	-0.260754	0.359002	0.147676	-0.081604	-0.104338	0.030644	-0.015378	-0.357856	-0.255804	-0.339459	-0.378149	-0.420441	-0.467214	0.359853	0.348900
grocery	"I will come clean to you, here and now, and admit that I do have ONE addiction.  That addiction is this totally wonderful Panda licorice.  For starters, it isn't too sweet. Secondly, it is made with anise oil and has a wonderful flavor.  Plus, the blurb on the side of the box is right.  Licorice does have mellowing properties and helps with digestion, and I also notice that I feel less stressed after I eat it.  [Or is this purely psychological?]  It's wonderful for those days when you are craving a treat, but don't want to feel guilty afterwards.  It's fat free and you should definitely keep it in on a high shelf out of reach, or you might find yourself eating the box in just a couple of days!"	3	-0.065696	0.319214	0.275634	-0.230025	-0.143027	0.171724	-0.078518	0.079628	0.097883	-0.072611	0.095373	0.009046	0.113410	0.080182	0.124826	-0.084655	-0.026963	0.070536	-0.222375	0.297803	0.110031	0.142250	-0.115242	-0.164463	0.067357	0.371477	-0.122760	-0.362323	0.021669	-0.124244	-0.033473	0.379593	-0.020892	-0.124471	0.141367	0.235909	-0.058194	0.212460	-0.003083	-0.315528	-0.057649	-0.172675	0.006393	-0.472908	-0.049379	0.005252	-0.007931	-0.117122	-0.005821	-0.599698	0.064926	-0.154560	-0.042794	0.672828	-0.088433	-1.565742	0.016670	-0.086315	1.075789	0.253908	-0.009551	0.675779	-0.296616	-0.110316	0.475177	-0.058058	0.459213	0.021178	-0.017116	-0.382674	0.047024	-0.169982	0.105687	-0.039856	0.098104	0.206528	-0.135826	-0.171114	-0.378989	0.064597	0.222548	-0.050357	-0.434684	0.194290	-1.010302	-0.190541	0.165126	0.040970	-0.296588	-0.186650	-0.108194	-0.053934	-0.013428	-0.150737	-0.407691	-0.092583	-0.140183	-0.327561	0.293057	0.204084

Just be careful if you have high blood pressure: it uses real licorice as the main flavoring & licorice root can increase a person's blood pressure.OK, Amazon, will you chicken out & block my review again??"	3	-0.100236	0.308243	0.319410	-0.247699	-0.074451	0.050323	-0.053816	0.079872	0.063561	-0.051405	0.161288	-0.044846	0.132453	0.015572	0.108917	-0.031721	0.068748	0.154280	-0.245548	0.320954	0.273282	0.035723	0.057360	-0.018728	0.137196	0.176548	-0.067104	-0.346035	0.014913	-0.180791	0.056440	0.462153	-0.032246	-0.065316	0.067415	0.311246	-0.030063	0.158183	0.010489	-0.304200	-0.083644	-0.244865	0.039497	-0.379956	-0.013320	0.009758	-0.015104	-0.271787	0.031381	-0.671482	0.132969	-0.056161	0.049586	0.839324	-0.261514	-1.914579	-0.035991	-0.030522	1.360044	0.288392	-0.125289	0.571362	-0.320826	-0.006259	0.693614	-0.007809	0.381250	0.170167	0.242023	-0.240191	-0.033145	-0.158786	0.004098	-0.098418	0.089381	0.104869	-0.094944	-0.047910	-0.617528	-0.010020	0.431347	-0.154194	-0.442544	0.047189	-1.125104	-0.244845	0.056159	-0.150676	-0.192240	-0.192469	-0.121264	-0.006905	-0.116284	-0.077455	-0.533671	-0.074598	-0.139298	-0.309936	0.422675	0.226413
grocery	"I see my review is pretty much in agreement with another review here. But I'll put it here anyway.I ordered this along with Pero Extra and Roastaroma to try the three. I'm a former Postum aficionado and had certainly developed quite a liking to Postum.Really can't take Pero Extra very much. I keep trying it again and again, prolly 10 times now, to see if I can develop a liking for it and just can't. I'm sure some people may like it, but it's just not for me.Cafix is what I'll usually go for, but it has a certain sort of built in sweetness (very mild, barely distinguishable)which comes from the beets that are added. Over time I've found it just sort of fills in some of the void from lack of Postum, and while it's not a Postum replica it has certain Postum like qualities.The Roastaroma actually is what I think tastes the best of the three, but it's taste is just not at all like Postum, is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it. Often I'll put just a little bit of Stevia powder in it. (I could always tell if I've ingested aspartame by (or nutrasweet, whatever) by how I felt, and try to verify any food/drink I ingest doesn't have aspartame. I mean, an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare, and itself found to be an effective weapon, really shouldn't be passed off as a food item. Stevia is ground plant matter, even less processed that sugar.)The combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink."	3	-0.142436	0.268224	0.343318	-0.176052	-0.204538	0.071552	-0.000656	0.144583	0.095253	-0.093670	0.089232	-0.000876	0.162637	0.026901	0.062583	-0.197289	0.015719	0.163894	-0.284293	0.179997	0.148606	0.054818	-0.039250	-0.199429	0.052046	0.102080	-0.156246	-0.399645	0.016140	-0.142599	-0.019646	0.454692	-0.026729	-0.078399	0.112844	0.307236	-0.016823	0.123143	0.004980	-0.228323	-0.173546	-0.211669	0.055083	-0.440225	-0.110915	-0.048580	0.167087	-0.196757	-0.059127	-0.747867	0.108933	-0.010456	0.056722	0.774817	-0.127722	-1.726592	-0.025152	-0.021868	1.152932	0.265722	-0.022776	0.705688	-0.282493	-0.022244	0.627524	-0.075141	0.391328	0.118092	-0.016310	-0.246125	0.052697	-0.215419	0.086968	-0.111329	0.152382	0.114781	-0.142109	-0.145259	-0.516544	0.091090	0.356326	-0.166393	-0.479720	0.082719	-1.121513	-0.193550	0.149291	-0.054649	-0.314957	-0.226605	-0.026026	-0.091928	-0.057463	-0.073075	-0.382417	-0.026425	-0.150175	-0.314340	0.308415	0.281146

grocery	"I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all.

That way it is not too intense for me."	3	-0.144131	0.344452	0.358566	-0.293194	-0.025519	0.262845	0.210183	0.065721	-0.143537	0.013940	-0.093720	-0.226569	0.105386	0.089916	0.185311	-0.042617	0.036367	0.047269	-0.205918	0.310263	0.203802	0.169976	-0.028274	-0.337087	0.046391	0.398240	-0.061392	-0.370868	-0.147171	-0.269587	-0.186698	0.432341	-0.155914	-0.115380	0.030118	0.401363	-0.021437	0.095561	0.069796	-0.361405	-0.087552	-0.373718	0.006836	-0.382955	-0.035188	0.057116	-0.100039	-0.269090	0.123044	-0.606600	-0.120863	0.080401	-0.029825	0.671485	-0.151768	-1.879546	-0.052100	0.153590	0.984143	0.236604	0.067603	0.759042	-0.178117	0.062941	0.546866	-0.251392	0.380994	-0.080005	-0.037517	-0.326492	-0.095342	-0.042195	0.030348	0.018613	0.163372	0.157428	-0.241653	-0.229799	-0.269215	0.011459	0.346295	-0.278916	-0.495738	0.264874	-0.903191	-0.123423	0.009300	-0.018295	-0.312268	-0.260980	-0.092909	0.014736	-0.244160	-0.155722	-0.424882	-0.206345	-0.297178	-0.377695	0.336126	0.420113

grocery	"This is a great product to accent your pizza and pasta sauces without adding the things you don't want into your diet!  It is a little bit hot as a seasoning and you can also sprinkle it onto spaghetti or pizza.  It is also very good when sprinkled onto casseroles or soups.  I like it as it has no calories, no total fat, no sodium, no carbohydrates and no additional protein.  It also contains no MSG or any preservatives.It lets you add the zest you like without adding items like salt or calories.  This is a good product and we like it as a seasoning for many of our Italian dishes.  I recommend it to you as a good product."	3	-0.367411	0.386818	0.178074	-0.246303	-0.044587	0.151322	0.098415	0.012778	-0.076881	0.044244	0.129876	-0.121192	0.077519	0.175040	0.191437	-0.021194	-0.038174	0.036583	-0.128227	0.321005	0.037782	0.243930	-0.028649	-0.129696	-0.064031	0.414436	-0.004735	-0.237183	-0.165121	-0.148469	0.068988	0.536673	-0.234939	-0.279085	0.056573	0.466672	0.141430	0.175326	-0.062727	-0.301412	0.151012	-0.567159	-0.038364	-0.580727	-0.015701	0.134261	-0.179406	-0.321084	-0.072470	-0.537386	0.012980	-0.007017	-0.053389	0.749792	-0.446593	-1.393503	-0.179795	0.033632	1.033955	0.318099	-0.159088	0.635939	-0.080864	0.089950	0.645620	-0.167048	0.431431	-0.102790	0.154468	-0.323433	-0.066446	-0.119177	0.297595	0.108358	0.248715	0.303654	-0.185763	-0.127026	-0.179512	0.080335	0.277130	-0.327120	-0.564616	0.264175	-0.892018	-0.142683	0.079201	-0.013394	-0.248585	-0.182719	-0.042931	-0.017360	-0.182012	-0.226738	-0.516134	-0.402188	-0.105677	-0.470974	0.511801	0.455302

grocery	"Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it's organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon. I know for the same price, this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods, but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product. It's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they don't make it bigger.

music	"It's hard to believe ""Memory of Trees"" came out 11 years ago;it has held up well over the passage of time.It's Enya's last great album before the New Age/pop of ""Amarantine"" and ""Day without rain."" Back in 1995,Enya still had her creative spark,her own voice.I agree with the reviewer who said that this is her saddest album;it is melancholy,bittersweet,from the opening title song.""Memory of Trees"" is elegaic&majestic.;""Pax Deorum"" sounds like it is from a Requiem Mass,it is a dark threnody.Unlike the reviewer who said that this has a ""disconcerting"" blend of spirituality&sensuality;,I don't find it disconcerting at all.""Anywhere is"" is a hopeful song,looking to possibilities.""Hope has a place"" is about love,but it is up to the listener to decide if it is romantic,platonic,etc.I've always had a soft spot for this song.""On my way home"" is a triumphant ending about return.This is truly a masterpiece of New Age music,a must for any Enya fan!"	4	-0.043465	0.312125	0.397409	-0.189909	0.062878	0.219512	-0.069859	0.106401	-0.038420	-0.057089	-0.002091	0.055515	0.061475	-0.021807	0.122279	-0.193438	0.141248	0.090523	-0.158173	0.364488	0.211007	0.005776	0.062158	-0.024195	0.287574	0.149407	-0.066194	-0.284634	0.182478	-0.139621	-0.141293	0.274390	-0.000830	0.093256	0.024313	0.145213	-0.022744	0.160538	0.020298	-0.357668	-0.218110	-0.047610	0.106992	-0.096600	-0.097051	-0.115141	0.155094	-0.238915	0.115486	-0.559715	0.046978	-0.118152	0.168961	0.688292	-0.109669	-1.962145	-0.022684	0.068980	1.033520	0.415877	-0.056090	0.739822	-0.325698	-0.093313	0.536653	-0.092458	0.436605	0.140554	0.066987	-0.326558	0.067901	-0.085244	0.025700	-0.207787	0.059669	0.099205	-0.075678	-0.139400	-0.462420	-0.166472	0.213579	-0.044807	-0.268351	0.188958	-1.035267	-0.108525	-0.012076	-0.187960	-0.216400	-0.112558	-0.052623	0.002366	-0.034000	0.153357	-0.388625	-0.048192	-0.306662	-0.270230	0.218628	0.285627
music	"A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely, quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno, and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you've never heard Enya before, you might want to start with one of her more popularized works, like Watermark, just to play it safe.  But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art."	4	-0.043706	0.268433	0.283487	-0.103742	0.142632	0.362701	-0.045315	0.075062	0.045861	0.029969	0.099410	0.007417	0.100752	0.000250	0.104085	-0.082583	0.127931	0.210971	-0.080737	0.297945	0.157499	-0.032240	0.123182	-0.237473	0.320807	0.044941	-0.207423	-0.257535	0.086522	-0.072153	-0.140788	0.221850	-0.041083	0.059493	0.002981	0.066418	0.042333	0.045248	0.036473	-0.373203	-0.024500	-0.004148	0.025025	-0.015999	0.006717	-0.083113	0.109899	-0.179730	0.160889	-0.547650	0.001509	-0.053514	0.159925	0.568695	0.002140	-1.648354	-0.008805	0.035198	0.914781	0.357728	0.130955	0.837913	-0.294448	-0.007791	0.537449	-0.056026	0.553611	-0.005768	0.048157	-0.345548	0.043098	-0.001528	0.105043	-0.184216	0.094516	0.073062	-0.041149	-0.107059	-0.246692	-0.151167	0.304082	-0.085762	-0.199920	0.115013	-1.022038	-0.041509	0.090826	-0.157736	-0.256356	-0.148424	0.007722	-0.083740	-0.043194	0.075243	-0.369852	-0.018389	-0.364732	-0.326365	0.231371	0.215539
music	"I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts, Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout, but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did. It makes it that much more special to all who own this album."	4	-0.021315	0.250269	0.389403	-0.055392	-0.042746	0.116003	-0.065030	0.129304	0.080450	0.020025	0.164384	0.049479	0.011590	-0.183444	0.110736	-0.279572	0.089014	0.078173	-0.241480	0.304563	0.207683	0.048686	-0.063814	-0.160918	0.154830	0.034251	-0.051672	-0.246503	0.138100	-0.211106	-0.093031	0.183059	0.096150	0.114652	0.080676	0.150364	-0.060678	0.173696	0.019745	-0.304355	-0.175249	-0.004579	0.065717	-0.050423	-0.116373	-0.036271	0.262661	-0.165809	0.158424	-0.510626	0.031026	-0.148578	0.187039	0.550379	-0.186432	-1.643422	0.091190	-0.023886	0.786434	0.268532	0.010068	0.758458	-0.231114	-0.109855	0.448254	-0.157559	0.384648	0.116755	0.012068	-0.402494	0.150853	-0.210193	0.103587	-0.154901	0.176958	0.055456	-0.067488	-0.134024	-0.205279	-0.196449	0.096524	0.073042	-0.250954	0.165661	-0.907814	-0.026653	0.115199	-0.234701	-0.162894	-0.120338	-0.154951	0.003950	-0.035745	0.009876	-0.406280	-0.065452	-0.307989	-0.186961	0.147544	0.314829
music	"This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!"	4	-0.069274	0.299561	0.402492	-0.245457	0.116363	0.279390	-0.104900	0.017165	-0.056850	-0.071737	0.206297	-0.062712	0.003057	0.091893	-0.126684	-0.203517	0.214149	0.055493	-0.220587	0.513646	0.185948	0.104894	0.177175	-0.308126	0.123295	0.130625	-0.033421	-0.393929	0.302059	-0.044638	-0.245860	0.476448	0.023492	0.132072	0.143036	0.167375	0.028123	0.203753	0.023757	-0.595740	-0.211711	0.054560	-0.034963	-0.101655	-0.157031	-0.156813	0.050280	-0.320194	0.104871	-0.785703	-0.080414	0.008439	0.048941	0.577045	-0.256411	-2.126294	-0.091765	0.176222	1.195967	0.396060	0.085143	0.821015	-0.397624	-0.185847	0.630227	-0.065881	0.464876	0.304179	0.125010	-0.358207	0.036150	0.003955	-0.018428	-0.191250	0.065761	0.169097	-0.123637	-0.168717	-0.347181	-0.269582	0.369476	-0.151879	-0.134433	0.135641	-1.228747	-0.183371	-0.102101	-0.293550	-0.325834	-0.090062	-0.058882	-0.048530	-0.150933	-0.125385	-0.485501	-0.045708	-0.424149	-0.202661	0.359199	0.376308
music	"Enya, despite being a successful recording artist, doesn't have the broad appeal as other artists; one reason might be that her kind of music is not very pop station friendly while another reason could be people think they're too ""macho"" for music that she makes. But people with open minds could find there's some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album's title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it's actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It's also a perfect length since it's under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you'd hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There's some songs she does where it's more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song's similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it's a more low-key track but it's also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one's a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it's not technically complex or fast but it's pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There's only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I've ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn't do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it's just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it's another wordless song although it's more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it's a bit more song-oriented. It's different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We're getting into the album's final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it's a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya's more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it's another beautiful track but it's also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it's another slower paced track complete with ""aahs"" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could've benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you'd think it was a bit more upbeat. While it's not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it's still one of her finest outings."	4	-0.118693	0.321685	0.381903	-0.154361	0.175669	0.239610	-0.070258	0.102745	-0.096034	-0.085328	0.159479	-0.019230	0.059111	0.042820	0.143131	-0.091244	0.037833	0.033962	-0.049884	0.374680	0.338164	-0.000495	0.146416	-0.067736	0.190668	0.044391	-0.161716	-0.257118	0.205367	-0.032463	-0.214679	0.260689	0.043039	0.048800	0.048406	0.153166	0.000752	0.130509	-0.020772	-0.300887	-0.031194	-0.129140	0.066641	-0.043714	-0.034167	-0.132857	0.105067	-0.233015	0.119035	-0.642920	-0.019926	-0.094274	0.127455	0.693971	-0.059442	-2.011098	-0.024718	0.040749	1.054624	0.418513	-0.053938	0.739833	-0.271445	-0.040009	0.544273	-0.086489	0.393906	0.160970	0.099425	-0.270963	-0.049770	-0.004472	0.004641	-0.116370	0.197376	0.152312	-0.057713	-0.083118	-0.254863	-0.230913	0.284897	-0.132235	-0.279535	0.033031	-1.130467	-0.081459	0.004590	-0.220575	-0.168093	-0.031678	-0.122227	0.039732	-0.143638	0.041543	-0.361772	-0.030973	-0.455945	-0.303405	0.343618	0.238528
music	"Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album."	4	-0.067055	0.281573	0.391818	-0.176891	0.111444	0.264269	-0.110190	0.057429	-0.097398	-0.088078	0.077187	-0.013367	0.086285	0.073813	0.135870	-0.134012	0.082975	0.096090	-0.066193	0.258844	0.232352	-0.008036	0.045132	-0.105207	0.225726	0.094410	-0.154277	-0.255754	0.211234	-0.093081	-0.138388	0.238295	0.019612	0.075251	0.008192	0.116754	-0.042291	0.132587	0.106323	-0.344549	-0.141815	-0.066393	0.034796	-0.033977	-0.079045	-0.043126	0.105721	-0.195621	0.122572	-0.602766	-0.026252	-0.061578	0.197229	0.668472	-0.058663	-1.894607	0.018590	0.085652	0.906499	0.375586	0.032506	0.793974	-0.247234	-0.021222	0.470469	-0.047470	0.407390	0.151129	0.026993	-0.292747	0.015586	-0.013612	-0.011677	-0.215630	0.084109	0.119135	-0.032991	-0.089282	-0.304314	-0.201264	0.245365	-0.074685	-0.246838	0.114064	-1.018181	-0.086778	0.000809	-0.237886	-0.151782	-0.089065	-0.054290	0.000825	-0.072675	0.069183	-0.333788	-0.049134	-0.443138	-0.280425	0.255609	0.241979
music	"Enya is one of a few artists whom I consider successful at creating this type of electronic atmospheric and dreamlike music. For certain, The Memory Of Trees is melodic, romantic and sensuous. Roma Ryan's lyrics, sung in  Gaelic by Enya (Athair Ar Neamh), float gently like pillow-soft white  clouds. The compositions are relaxing and harmonious (Tea House Moon),  dreamlike and filled with mystery (Once You Had Gold), and include subtle  touches of Celtic tradition (Enya's phrasing on `Hope Has A Place'). The CD  is a quiet and lush alternative to ninety-percent of the popular music on  the market today, and also a welcome substitute for the often hectic pace  of daily life. Enya's arrangement of the compositions on Memory is well  thought - the comparatively dramatic and uplifting `Anywhere Is' and `On My  Way Home' are placed so that the listener doesn't fall asleep.However,  I'm very leery when I read a dozen reviews of a particular musical release,  and all the writers rate the artist's work with five-stars. My hesitation  is not a matter of taste (listeners are free to condemn or rave about  whatever they please), but one of perspective. Is The Memory Of Trees a  musical ground breaking effort? Does it introduce a unique technique or  significantly alter a current genre of popular music? On close listening,  the electronic pseudo-symphonic music of Memory does not approach the  beauty or dynamics of an orchestra with real people playing real  instruments. Nor does Enya's multi-layering of her own voice have the same  rich sonic texture as a chorus comprised of real voices. Then again,  perhaps The Memory Of Trees (and all of Enya's work) is so provocatively  ethereal because it is surreal."	4	-0.108269	0.337111	0.222486	-0.008881	0.175448	0.271065	-0.155050	-0.008488	-0.121043	0.029341	-0.055905	-0.114725	0.023385	-0.053323	0.122499	-0.082152	0.065641	0.021544	0.047145	0.253743	0.095885	-0.059931	0.131216	-0.193282	0.168827	0.000718	-0.065844	-0.224260	0.047979	-0.097888	-0.162184	0.234946	-0.145675	0.010274	0.039356	0.064232	0.094064	0.094323	-0.052134	-0.371727	-0.092975	-0.110335	-0.019001	0.093167	-0.065091	-0.086744	0.074941	-0.146472	0.090990	-0.501331	0.030518	-0.063653	0.126137	0.536644	-0.013487	-1.614563	0.002023	0.024812	0.933830	0.318631	0.063526	0.756250	-0.206874	-0.057428	0.471792	-0.111478	0.411500	0.022373	0.191261	-0.333867	-0.029428	0.003515	0.128871	-0.144126	0.057040	0.052431	-0.057031	-0.121645	-0.252632	-0.163484	0.176421	-0.040519	-0.177040	0.099735	-1.000269	-0.012735	0.001426	-0.131894	-0.187173	-0.123684	-0.042157	0.004429	-0.093385	0.059525	-0.276699	-0.039839	-0.396722	-0.375949	0.303518	0.248913
music	"Enya is one of of the most mysterious singers in music today. I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece. It's gorgeous and an album for the soul..."	4	-0.144582	0.271517	0.369088	-0.141456	0.221413	0.260919	-0.050356	0.097122	-0.125825	-0.074576	0.072743	0.009939	0.105345	0.057173	0.152481	-0.139721	0.089867	-0.033302	0.037311	0.229816	0.288399	-0.016608	0.066389	-0.017582	0.211710	0.132582	-0.142571	-0.221411	0.197728	-0.095327	-0.144008	0.141876	0.039713	0.042996	0.017570	0.152338	0.014490	0.062764	-0.001235	-0.318853	-0.131846	-0.063189	0.034627	0.030445	0.037001	-0.071807	0.052346	-0.163852	0.163180	-0.534020	-0.010415	-0.074342	0.195565	0.629282	-0.049425	-1.852427	-0.014479	0.127799	0.901103	0.392561	-0.049002	0.818087	-0.291011	-0.051321	0.457075	-0.062725	0.433962	0.066132	0.061113	-0.335076	-0.012379	0.009760	0.036142	-0.092645	0.110525	0.163033	-0.062997	-0.117456	-0.194735	-0.145438	0.229858	-0.061067	-0.229580	0.088067	-0.949391	-0.089266	-0.066462	-0.250851	-0.071728	0.065916	-0.040596	-0.015447	-0.151680	0.072792	-0.361601	-0.066044	-0.515742	-0.206512	0.200832	0.165692
music	"This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music, well written and performed with emotion. It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me. She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic. On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record, with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain. I have every Enya album to date, but this one seems to be particularly special. A must for any music lover!"	4	-0.029968	0.253552	0.389322	-0.216629	0.172952	0.277086	0.001461	0.078361	-0.028254	-0.036013	0.050232	-0.021255	0.108145	0.052738	0.054953	-0.092493	0.092888	0.121548	-0.071111	0.367823	0.213244	-0.102227	0.060378	-0.182429	0.217917	0.124789	-0.034998	-0.295333	0.349639	-0.152605	-0.104088	0.338420	0.028047	0.097545	-0.060080	0.104146	-0.068265	0.074467	-0.024249	-0.435059	-0.137903	0.127020	-0.022886	0.009574	-0.019674	-0.130367	0.032485	-0.251532	0.118614	-0.573972	0.052487	-0.008719	0.210320	0.551957	-0.066537	-1.945293	-0.041544	0.043706	0.984241	0.426716	0.104029	0.816637	-0.325532	-0.079703	0.613912	-0.079490	0.380819	0.081141	0.085254	-0.331800	-0.023226	0.060316	0.039919	-0.020444	0.156206	0.114340	-0.148938	-0.189740	-0.326445	-0.199150	0.188622	-0.010591	-0.225998	0.028056	-1.139001	-0.070806	0.031684	-0.253045	-0.245293	-0.094251	-0.185312	0.007269	-0.135433	0.033682	-0.193833	-0.003661	-0.457295	-0.292221	0.198310	0.193684
music	"Many times, AND WITH GOOD REASON, the ""new age"" label gets slammed for lacking originality and conviction. Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is, in my opinion, her best to date.There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist, but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers. And if you look at what is being released these days, many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya, but don't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know. I know this sounds ridiculous, but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music. Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music, it works even better when it's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.Many artists/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table, but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line, but rather reflects a balance of the artist's intent with the listener in mind.Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions (even when I disagree) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work. Also, thanks to Amazon.com for providing this forum as I think that it clearly benefits the company, but ultimately it also can be a great place for a potential buyer to find his or her next favorite CD."	4	-0.038430	0.324311	0.347629	-0.108580	0.128792	0.095611	-0.150066	-0.038914	-0.062633	-0.026576	0.060544	-0.165026	0.088704	-0.117061	0.004054	-0.168701	0.111185	0.101126	-0.141412	0.346895	0.086427	-0.049064	0.093055	-0.191306	0.127591	-0.062972	-0.005573	-0.339617	0.056351	-0.144688	-0.085978	0.379119	-0.128188	-0.001597	0.094678	0.143467	-0.030590	0.088108	-0.105101	-0.332232	-0.203405	-0.031852	0.022209	-0.070339	-0.133030	-0.172074	0.071097	-0.267115	0.080160	-0.634362	0.108626	-0.053485	0.045164	0.731524	-0.028366	-1.854251	-0.001064	-0.109362	1.105476	0.349033	-0.016983	0.757575	-0.254843	-0.026640	0.621594	-0.049838	0.396353	0.137023	0.153191	-0.244460	0.044313	-0.004608	0.001960	-0.179709	0.159365	0.075555	-0.068266	-0.168989	-0.418882	-0.190131	0.279707	-0.020165	-0.302698	0.051849	-1.218874	-0.136981	-0.030253	-0.194735	-0.294173	-0.210071	-0.048326	-0.100529	-0.031554	-0.057694	-0.317930	0.023928	-0.390828	-0.351032	0.407106	0.299971
music	I just recently purchased her ''Paint The Sky With Stars'' CD and was so impressed that I bought 3 of her previously released CD's and plan to buy all her music.  She is truely talented and her music is very unique with a combination of modern classical and pop with a hint of an Angelic tone. I still recommend you buy this CD.

music	"Over the past twenty-odd years, Enya Brennan has become known worldwide for her layered vocals and delicate instrumentation, in many ways defining New Age music. But for her to have essentially taken the crown of this genre implies a depth to her music, and this is very evident on ""The Memory of Trees"".Enya's first few albums were good, but there was something missing, something that had yet to be developed. I'm not entirely sure what that intangible ""something"" was, but she certainly found it on this one. The title track is an instrumental masterpiece featuring her trademark layered vocals (though no lyrics to speak of), and it reminds on of a clear fall day. This sets the pace for the record, which is decidedly autumnal. 'Anywhere Is' is about the maze that life's choices put us into, while 'Pax Deorum' features few lyrics (all in Latin) that reverberate almost like a dark stormy night that eventually settles into a calm drizzle. 'Once You had Gold' is as delicate as a falling leaf, and 'On My Way Home' brings back memories of weekend trips home from college, traveling through the gorgeous foliage and dizzying scents of fall.If 'Only Time' defined her ""A Day without Rain"" album, it's 'China Roses' that defines ""The Memory of Trees"". Enya has crafted a lullaby-like soothing piece of moonlight that is instantly calming. It's easily the best piece of the record and, even nearly twenty years after the album's release, it still stands firmly, refusing to sound dated in a genre that, at one point, relied a little too much on synthesizers.It's been over fifteen years since ""The Memory of Trees"" was released, but it's a still favorite when it comes to Enya's music. As another reviewer said, you can't go wrong with this artist, but this album is definitely one of her best."	4	-0.119090	0.278203	0.373290	-0.095501	0.218831	0.233234	-0.049639	0.067779	-0.094700	-0.051455	0.111708	0.025682	0.164212	0.003738	0.108475	-0.140870	0.122890	0.051870	-0.067966	0.220712	0.235409	-0.006093	0.177089	-0.035369	0.246517	0.014427	-0.110942	-0.312752	0.055494	-0.132191	-0.101508	0.227192	-0.043600	0.056174	-0.005758	0.166062	-0.052762	0.070822	-0.042335	-0.300011	-0.156079	-0.099096	0.093162	0.003921	-0.069546	-0.064184	0.166203	-0.170901	0.082571	-0.587864	0.051113	-0.150354	0.156706	0.742529	-0.038770	-1.887903	-0.029208	-0.009791	1.051358	0.414055	0.006713	0.804210	-0.202789	-0.026779	0.511219	-0.097570	0.401268	0.090668	0.133417	-0.286476	0.005083	-0.000431	0.020733	-0.054715	0.159086	0.075494	-0.102623	-0.107751	-0.392070	-0.099622	0.300114	-0.041930	-0.289681	0.132820	-1.003974	-0.103796	0.006224	-0.231595	-0.194119	-0.088123	-0.086477	-0.008637	-0.132141	0.061474	-0.346912	-0.049499	-0.388057	-0.258798	0.283269	0.215022

music	"The problem with Enya is that she is so consistently good.  It is difficult to write a review that says something different from previous reviews (having recently reviewed ""A Day without Rain"" and previously ""Watermark"").  The same words, ethereal, ephemeral, airy, haunting, and spiritual apply to each album.  The only risk is that my reviews become boring, because Enya could never be.This CD begins with the instrumental track ""The Memory of Trees.""  While ""The Memory of Trees"" is nominally an instrumental, there are voices that punctuate portions of the music.  This opening feels optimistic, though the title feels as though it is vaguely related to forests and lands gone by.  The vocals provide a chorale sound that builds and cascades around you with the feeling of great trees and landscapes greater than any of the puny works of mankind.  Great beasts wander about and smaller beasts enter and exit the brush at the edges of clearings in the great forest in a celebration of nature.The pace speeds up in the peppy ""Anywhere Is.""  The lyrics are poetic and symbolic and are a mirror maze of mental images.  As is frequently typical of Enya the lyrics seem to make sense until you attempt to understand them and then their meaning escapes your grasp.  In this case the song seems to be describing the paths we take in life and the choices that we make, and whether they can be unmade, and even whether the choices take us to or from the one we love.  Another unusual feature of this song is the predominant instruments which compete for attention with Enya's voice.  Typically Enya's voice stands out clearly from the instruments, which in this case are mostly strings and piano.""Pax Deorum"" is somewhat ominous, and fits with the following song, ""Athair Ar Neamh.""  Both songs are simple songs that relate to God.  ""Pax Deorum"" translates roughly as ""The Peace of the Gods,"" or seeking to placate the gods.  ""Athair Ar Neamh"" translates approximately as ""Father in Heaven.""  Note that the title of the latter song appears as a line in the former song, tying both songs together, and placing an Irish Gaelic line into a Latin song.  There are moments of choral lightness in the otherwise ominous ""Pax Deorum,"" which I believe has appeared as the background music for a commercial.  The latter song is more contemplative and ethereal and Enya allows the beauty of her voice to caress and harmonize the Irish Gaelic verses.""From Where I Am"" is a relatively sedate instrumental that forms a brief piano interlude leading into ""China Roses.""  This song manages to capture the wonder of the universe and the beauty of heaven all in one song.  This song transcends the poetic to the surrealistic both lyrically and vocally.  Once again Enya allows her voice to be a beautiful instrument to complement the strings and piano to create a work of aural art.""Hope Has a Place"" is the first song where the lyrics are relatively easy to understand.  The concept is simple: there is always hope where there is love.  The vocals are beautiful (again) and may remind a listener of the song Enya wrote for ""The Lord of the Rings.""  This song is for romantics and candle-lit dinners everywhere.Another instrumental interlude follows.  ""Tea-House Moon"" has some of the most interesting instrumental effects on this CD.  The mood is contemplative and traditional, though with a vaguely Asian flavor.  This instrumental is the music for a heavenly choreography.The next song changes style, again, and yet fits within the character of the album.  ""Once You Had Gold"" seems to allude to the transitory nature of all things, perhaps most particularly life.  There are lines that seem to say that things come and things go, and you need to accept the joys that you can get just from being here to greet the new day.  I particularly like the last line which says that there are no promises in life, that there is good and bad and that one must make the best of any situation.  The song is sung in a fairy tale style, a cautionary tale young and old.The next song translates as ""The Dreamer.""  The music tells you all you need to know about the words, which are surrealistic and, of course, dream-like.  The ephemeral lyrics and music bespeaks an atmosphere, a feeling, a place that can only exist in our dreams, though we might wish otherwise.  This song nearly achieves allowing us to be a creation of our imagination.At last we must awaken from the fantasy Enya has woven for us.  ""On My Way Home"" returns us to this place and time, but with a longing for the place we leave, the poetry that has been woven for us.  Yet, we rejoice for we return to a place of familiarity, and still, there is the memory, yes indeed, ""The Memory of Trees."""	4	-0.106072	0.276240	0.357657	-0.051047	0.206612	0.294205	-0.164475	-0.007763	-0.023179	-0.078464	-0.017250	0.016106	0.125060	0.019941	0.067330	-0.112841	0.107226	0.099275	-0.093060	0.270421	0.199966	-0.129020	0.108107	-0.109811	0.144826	0.040017	-0.141184	-0.246088	0.105263	-0.103747	-0.162343	0.233285	-0.062585	-0.038324	0.013109	0.140757	0.024182	0.110642	-0.026870	-0.345683	-0.137243	-0.038749	0.021203	0.013524	-0.074090	-0.089569	0.133743	-0.136592	0.070649	-0.518637	0.046968	-0.031795	0.266088	0.643732	-0.009639	-1.736300	0.074988	0.010428	0.891889	0.321601	0.026098	0.725885	-0.214788	-0.103686	0.524750	-0.071343	0.374517	0.079988	0.077674	-0.342773	0.014832	-0.027597	0.059403	-0.161356	0.155375	0.082257	-0.081273	-0.112790	-0.302461	-0.167432	0.150357	-0.025582	-0.233349	0.083840	-1.071296	-0.011547	-0.052349	-0.242711	-0.108029	-0.070641	-0.091745	-0.024584	-0.077335	0.062735	-0.257272	-0.085888	-0.411373	-0.338488	0.246474	0.251653
music	"If for some reason you're interested in only a selection of the songs herein, the same recordings of ""Anywhere Is"", ""China Roses"", ""The Memory of Trees"", and ""On My Way Home"" have been collected on PAINT THE SKY WITH STARS.Enya composed all the music, sang all the songs, and provided all the accompaniment;  Roma Ryan wrote the lyrics; Nicky Ryan helped with the arrangements and handled the engineering and mixing. Except where noted otherwise, each song is sung in English.Enya is one of the best composers and performers I know to unwind with; another in this category is Ryan Miller, who composed the soundtracks for the video games MYST and RIVEN.""The Memory of Trees"" (instrumental and voices, no lyrics) Waltz tempo, opening with electronic keyboard, joined by piano. Enya joins in vocally but without words partway through. The main theme is about six notes long, continually repeated with variations. One of my two favourites on this CD, ranked only after ""China Roses"".""Anywhere Is"" Unusually staccato for Enya, mainly string accompaniment. No percussion, some piano. The lyrics are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus, when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the words a little. (""You go there you're gone forever / I go there I'll lose my way / if we stay here we're not together / Anywhere is"").""Pax Deorum"" (sung in Latin) Noticeably deeper pitched-chorus and accompaniment than usual. The accompaniment includes some percussion, in this case base drum, although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard.""Athair ar Neamh"" is sung in Gaelic, with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that Enya's voice carries the main lyrics very clearly. During the chorus, a multiple-track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blurs the effect a little. Very clear and bell-like, on the whole.""From Where I Am"" (instrumental only) Specifically piano. As usual with Enya, her piano solo here makes me think of water imagery.""China Roses"" Waltz tempo again, opening with electronic keyboard, but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano. ""I know that if I have heaven / there is nothing to desire; Rain and river, a world of wonder / may be paradise to me."" Most of the verses contain a reference to heaven, the night sky.""Hope Has a Place"" I would tentatively call this waltz tempo again, but it's very slow, and the beat isn't quite regular. Enya's singing comes through very clearly herein (except for the more complex choruses, as usual). The accompaniment consists of very simple chords on an electric keyboard so as not to drown out the singing. The refrain is ""Hope has a place in a lover's heart.""""Tea House Moon"" (instrumental) Unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one. Doesn't seem typical of Enya's work.""Once You Had Gold"", 'once you had silver / Then came the rains / out of the blue. / Ever and always, / always and ever,"" with the refrain ""Time gave both darkness and dreams to you."" Waltz tempo again, almost a lullaby in this instance, Enya's singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus.""La Sonadora"" - Sung in Spanish, very drowsily, waltz tempo again. The quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string, with organ joining in after a couple of verses.""On My Way Home"" - Opens with organ accompaniment, as in the later part of the previous song, but then switches to a very staccato keyboard accompanying Enya's singing. ""On my way home / I remember / only good days."""	4	-0.114104	0.327374	0.271486	-0.108454	0.251436	0.368439	-0.088252	0.063828	-0.127036	-0.098082	0.067062	-0.050188	0.019996	0.165707	0.072066	-0.122297	0.037320	0.041622	-0.003008	0.114433	0.187464	-0.050590	0.130580	-0.101524	0.179013	0.032572	-0.241231	-0.168520	0.221337	0.003360	-0.206278	0.220604	0.030232	0.037792	0.042941	0.099797	0.106593	0.060342	0.001882	-0.366441	-0.052007	-0.025550	0.027719	0.062924	-0.012760	-0.106663	0.066699	-0.265975	0.115547	-0.560286	-0.036553	0.028162	0.166904	0.532104	-0.066046	-1.679004	-0.070818	0.006616	0.845267	0.447651	0.006918	0.639494	-0.203275	-0.032115	0.395368	-0.100599	0.392057	0.124514	0.119478	-0.213561	-0.081882	-0.012195	0.120087	-0.150449	0.154691	0.113511	-0.099984	-0.056758	-0.139942	-0.192239	0.247101	-0.196652	-0.276340	0.053172	-1.077799	-0.019376	-0.009190	-0.243967	-0.117729	0.041376	-0.171221	0.017894	-0.130327	0.125989	-0.218186	-0.017797	-0.456771	-0.315398	0.309537	0.235734
music	"Released five years after 'Shepherd Moons', during which 'The Celts' had been re-released, 'The Memory of Trees' was much-anticipated by fans of Enya, and turned out to be only slightly less impressive than the previous  two albums.The Christmassy lead single, 'Anywhere Is', set the tone  excellently - an extremely simple and addictive tune, repeated constantly,  it was fun, and not at all serious. The rest of the album seemed a  reflection of this, and as with 'Watermark' it was a generally cheery  collection. Still, despite an excellent set of opening songs, the album  seemed to bog down into too many ballads towards the end ('La Sonadora',  although introducing Spanish to Enya's vocabulary, went on and on and on),  despite the presence of the rousing 'On my way home' as a closing song. The  title track seemed uncomfortably close to being a cliche, too.Despite  all that, it was business as before - the production seemed more earthy and  less ethereal, and 'On my way home' was the closest thing to a mainstream  single Enya has ever done."	4	-0.101645	0.192382	0.358473	-0.118335	0.168489	0.207833	-0.025192	0.055334	-0.077450	-0.008990	0.077247	-0.014582	0.103713	-0.108097	0.108745	-0.147923	0.052320	0.023603	-0.030111	0.178963	0.393148	-0.023231	0.103795	-0.027946	0.192354	-0.060213	-0.133456	-0.268882	0.050106	-0.055766	-0.103142	0.164320	-0.037051	0.076970	0.092481	0.187435	-0.029372	0.083006	-0.136656	-0.226255	-0.109175	-0.093711	0.116085	0.082012	0.022246	-0.109738	0.240427	-0.205849	0.118012	-0.644828	0.099298	-0.138924	0.166354	0.725759	-0.085024	-1.938608	-0.032806	-0.041968	1.053896	0.395055	-0.070754	0.673818	-0.259596	-0.035381	0.505223	-0.052471	0.319916	0.083580	0.079031	-0.302227	-0.001494	-0.003091	-0.000592	-0.171158	0.119104	0.073913	-0.178503	-0.086657	-0.381056	-0.126028	0.309216	-0.002874	-0.280976	0.144640	-1.093391	-0.167154	0.014460	-0.148482	-0.253691	-0.085361	-0.126069	0.019029	-0.217019	0.092769	-0.356001	-0.041731	-0.426179	-0.187779	0.316885	0.212878
music	"(...)She is one of a kind, and this album only enhances her contribution to musical enjoyment. As always, the instrumental opening sets a mood, followed by the lively ""Anywhere Is"", a song which grew on me each time I listened. Each song is exquisite, but for me, ""China Roses"" is the most delicately crafted song. However, ""Once You Had Gold"" which isn't mentioned as much is another of the highpoints. ""On My Way Home"" is a fitting conclusion to the album. I have heard rumors that not everybody likes Enya, and if there is a person who doesn't like her, then he or she shouldn't get this CD, but for everybody else, this is one of the essential CD's for your collection."	4	-0.052873	0.230722	0.404606	-0.125254	0.282277	0.292543	-0.052802	0.106678	0.009335	-0.092076	0.142670	-0.000141	0.097034	0.015855	0.073385	-0.075840	0.101146	0.137802	-0.078005	0.233024	0.270860	-0.038565	0.056526	-0.133735	0.210846	0.116554	-0.157326	-0.329029	0.162915	-0.147673	-0.228725	0.329997	0.153519	0.138961	0.074340	0.162790	-0.037134	0.142363	-0.048689	-0.438287	-0.079947	-0.043927	0.184051	-0.018757	-0.102701	-0.123518	0.050749	-0.268069	0.141460	-0.710371	0.102734	-0.027712	0.201218	0.653359	-0.137869	-1.933151	-0.028449	0.021647	0.931970	0.377403	0.036915	0.788957	-0.247649	-0.045960	0.526481	-0.117657	0.474239	0.154954	0.081000	-0.240677	0.104589	0.045262	0.044982	-0.107030	0.215326	0.328555	-0.090088	-0.278647	-0.350990	-0.167741	0.266347	0.030890	-0.186231	0.047733	-1.162958	-0.111221	-0.141452	-0.319355	-0.244272	-0.144205	-0.064076	-0.102204	-0.056236	-0.008738	-0.294637	-0.055330	-0.411892	-0.264770	0.265420	0.310576
music	"What an enchanting collection this is. I fell in love with Enya's music right from her first hit `Orinocco flow' and have been a fan ever since.Enya's haunting and ethereal voice, coupled with rich, magical musical arrangements, layered dreamy sounding backing vocals, and lyrics sung in English, Latin, and Gaelic, set her aside form all other new age artists.Opening track `Memory of trees' is a beautiful instrumental with angelic voices flitting in and out.`Anywhere is' has an upbeat tempo, cutting strings, lush instrumentation, and poetic lyrics.`Tea-house moon' is an instrumental with a Chinese sound. Magical keyboards (I think) set against a delicate backdrop. Beautiful! Just as delicate is `La So&ntilde;adora' with very ethereal vocals against a gently brooding soundscape. Then there's the tender piano instrumental `From where I am'.`Pax deorum' (sung in latin) will have you checking to see you're not in a monastery. Very religious sounding!The absolute standout has got to be `Athair ar nearmh' (sung in Gaelic). This song is stunning! Angelic vocals, delicate piano, with delicate strings sweeping in and out. Mournful sounding but outstanding!A magical, delicate, angelic experience!"	4	-0.074961	0.340099	0.332785	-0.058146	0.274586	0.403634	-0.144677	-0.021072	-0.090394	0.067523	0.029322	-0.050846	0.018912	0.143052	0.113044	-0.034003	0.034647	0.017143	0.124476	0.224305	0.159008	-0.019577	0.158862	-0.139828	0.215808	0.118474	-0.219189	-0.075076	0.121341	-0.075638	-0.219995	0.085176	0.026600	0.008739	-0.060223	0.020477	0.043290	0.138934	0.027237	-0.406294	-0.024908	-0.079553	-0.001210	0.129222	0.026442	-0.106616	0.040917	-0.120056	0.136881	-0.465007	-0.059792	0.037034	0.237116	0.472614	-0.070725	-1.665145	0.117215	0.124227	0.715881	0.366408	0.137401	0.670324	-0.300189	-0.082572	0.370183	-0.195303	0.402472	0.096511	0.131615	-0.343373	0.024200	0.100037	0.036817	-0.222861	0.138475	0.102503	-0.154910	-0.050922	-0.081284	-0.242215	0.227254	-0.120481	-0.096433	0.048803	-0.962874	0.053919	0.076494	-0.190122	-0.116503	-0.087204	-0.112671	0.042038	-0.151705	0.127347	-0.251533	-0.071082	-0.628369	-0.443231	0.224741	0.251244
music	"Enya - The Memory of Trees (1995)In certain circles, such as my profession, massage therapy, Enya is ubiquitous. People tend to get really tired of hearing her all the time. E.O. - Enya Overdose - can be an unpleasant, almost sickly experience. Aside from that, I think some people are just jealous of her enormous popularity. I just learned that her ""Day Without Rain"" CD which came out in 2000 was the 16th highest seller of the last decade.But she's wildly popular for good reasons. One could say her music is synthesized plastic, but it's beautiful, soothing plastic . . . what's not plastic is Enya's sweet, melodic voice (at least I HOPE it's not plastic! - I sincerely doubt she uses auto-tune). Enya's been accused of being soulless - harsh! - but sometimes you'd rather hear something calming, pleasant and pretty instead of some gut-wrenching Aretha Franklin or Janis Joplin weeper, wouldn't you?The following is a song-by-song breakdown of the album to give readers an idea of which tracks they might like to sample before getting the whole album:""The Memory of Trees"" - a majestic, cinematic opener. No lyrics, it serves as a wonderful prelude. *****""Anywhere Is"" - I know some people like this one but I find it unbearable. To me, it's too cloying, ""sing-songy"" and flat-out dorky. It's just too ""jaunty"" for my tastes. I'm forced to program the songs on my CD player whenever I want to hear this album because I refuse to listen to this one (and of course, I program only certain songs from this album for massage). I was shocked to see it on Enya's Greatest Hits collection. *""Pax Deorum"" - Quite different than anything else here, this track has an ominous, pulsing sound which makes me think of impending war in some Medieval or Lord of the Rings setting. Enya chants most of the words, sung in Gallic, in a low register. I never use it for massage but it's an interesting track if yer in the mood for it. ***1/2""Athair Ar Neamh"" - Another one sung in Gallic, this soft, restrained song is one of the most beautiful on the album. *****+""From Where I Am"" - is a short instrumental with only piano and some very subtle atmospheric touches. A sweet melody. *****""China Roses"" - possibly Enya's best song ever. Sounds like floating through heaven. Magical! *****+""Hope Has a Place"" - a gentle song about love. ****1/2""Tea-House Moon"" - a pretty instrumental, vaguely Oriental. ****""Once You Had Gold"" - another, soft, sweet song with a gorgeous melody. ****1/2""La Sonadora"" - is a subtle, slightly somber track sung in Spanish. ****""On My Way Home"" - begins with some rolling, old-school synth sounds reminiscent of her first album and soon bursts with bright energy. A fitting finale. ****"	4	-0.094849	0.289877	0.333824	-0.156674	0.081162	0.299422	-0.056851	0.088675	-0.012396	-0.042524	0.087212	-0.012356	0.035816	0.081699	0.156533	-0.128066	0.070426	0.021328	-0.066803	0.291088	0.273460	0.007628	0.052441	-0.103776	0.165094	0.180379	-0.147006	-0.261725	0.173518	-0.092530	-0.103002	0.271419	0.013792	0.043404	-0.015644	0.121466	-0.019268	0.110897	0.043061	-0.364698	-0.069734	-0.102580	0.009361	-0.085073	-0.052513	-0.065132	0.064700	-0.145569	0.035184	-0.593604	-0.008073	-0.080597	0.200267	0.585758	-0.127086	-1.767337	0.024860	0.100069	0.938967	0.311740	0.021776	0.742550	-0.263390	-0.077408	0.449498	-0.083112	0.428898	0.097436	0.074820	-0.317079	-0.019262	-0.007269	0.022835	-0.093878	0.112494	0.186348	-0.032707	-0.121888	-0.276169	-0.173480	0.280854	-0.126881	-0.269913	0.091596	-1.031643	-0.081547	-0.021275	-0.219719	-0.173243	-0.078928	-0.041558	0.016370	-0.103258	0.079578	-0.301746	-0.069184	-0.409400	-0.295275	0.231984	0.209349
music	"Enya has one of the most beautiful voices of this day. Her voice is fitting for the style of music she sings. Clear as a bell, her voice is airy and light, as she sings in English, Latin, or Gaelic. There is a lot of power in her voice. The music she chooses supports her voice appropriately, and adds to her sound. She has the ability to conjure up images with each note she sings. Like all of her previous albums, this one is again excellent.There are a many great songs on this album. ""China Roses"" has that airy sound that Enya is well known for. She sings the backing vocal as an arpeggio of three long notes of just her voice. Over it, she sings the lyrics of the song in her crisp tone, almost like a crystal bell ringing. The Latin sounding ""Pax Deorum"" has a medieval sound to it. Again, she utilizes her voice singing in the background, to add counterpoint to the lyrics.  ""Anywhere Is"" sounds like the perfect single for the album. Much more upbeat than the other songs, it has a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song. On the opposite end of the spectrum is ""Hope Has a Place"". Here her voice has a very haunting quality to it, made even more so with the organ playing behind her. It is a very beautiful song.I'm amazed at how Enya can keep making new albums that sound similar to her previous ones, yet be totally new for the listener as well. Her voice is aging well, and she seems to improve with each passing album. I hope to hear much more from her in the future, as there is always room in my collection for her beautiful voice."	4	-0.119850	0.338503	0.382686	-0.151116	0.286700	0.342929	-0.151120	-0.058564	-0.077698	-0.015893	-0.008401	-0.102114	0.029322	0.141732	0.101089	-0.134858	0.044888	0.019839	0.078350	0.332233	0.155187	-0.042550	0.115046	-0.243397	0.227334	0.059719	-0.146468	-0.156651	0.191088	0.024225	-0.122086	0.335426	0.025011	0.117117	0.053268	0.117245	0.018283	0.069790	0.062547	-0.409718	-0.064022	-0.102050	0.004993	0.097147	-0.061509	-0.128173	0.113285	-0.268524	0.161466	-0.665702	0.000464	0.012981	0.263926	0.621004	-0.032235	-1.998982	0.095445	0.025877	0.893783	0.359400	0.126161	0.747981	-0.258827	-0.070585	0.432593	-0.144009	0.495524	0.119525	0.095846	-0.313842	0.054997	0.063155	0.080505	-0.261117	0.316295	0.131061	-0.090607	-0.112873	-0.205612	-0.329925	0.256340	-0.178055	-0.201131	0.115338	-1.186121	-0.044083	0.040003	-0.275991	-0.166697	-0.022282	-0.030858	0.009313	-0.158320	0.087111	-0.324791	-0.021907	-0.640253	-0.395135	0.303274	0.316975
music	"Remember when you were but a small child, and when you had trouble falling asleep your parents would come and bring you into a lull with nursery rhymes? In short, that's what ""The Memory Of Trees"" is, a collection of sweet and hushed songs designed to put one at ease and carry them into a peaceful sleep. Now one would think that since the title of the album deals with trees, the whole work itself would have an environmental theme to each of its songs, but it does not. Enya started this cycle when her debut album ""The Celts"" featured celtic chants and jigs, her second album ""Watermark"" had a collection of water themed songs, and her third album ""Shepherd Moons"" had songs that dealt with a world beyond this one. Actually, ""The Memory Of Trees"" does a very nice job of breaking this cycle, because there are only a few songs that deal with anything related to trees or the environment, and all of them are highlights of the album. These include ""The Memory Of Trees"", which is the opening track and one of her best songs ever composed, ""China Roses"", a beautifully crafted pastorale and ""La Sonadora"", a descriptive narration of dreams of landscapes. This album is probably one of the few Enya collections that have 3 instrumental tracks, all of which are very nice transitions to each section of the album. I do not advise you to play the album in its entirety in your car, because you will surely fall asleep. True that's the greatest strength of the album, but also its fatal weakness. If you manage to stay awake through all eleven lullabies, your purchase was very well worth it."	4	-0.108522	0.249498	0.286912	-0.140523	0.286669	0.208594	-0.058298	0.102171	-0.094938	-0.081205	0.160731	0.035669	0.168827	0.033415	0.062754	-0.092204	0.188002	0.139718	-0.118767	0.242166	0.272884	-0.128742	0.146539	-0.017129	0.204556	-0.009050	-0.151013	-0.264657	0.087082	-0.029749	-0.222980	0.174349	0.007729	0.096771	-0.015052	0.177824	0.046813	0.086405	-0.042254	-0.342463	-0.058868	-0.037841	0.042317	0.035005	0.019871	-0.024117	0.075261	-0.223926	0.028114	-0.576931	-0.035638	-0.088643	0.109754	0.673819	0.001978	-1.850288	-0.017321	0.016803	0.993521	0.414948	0.030007	0.787253	-0.238683	-0.061918	0.610119	-0.039174	0.347019	0.085010	0.196865	-0.457768	-0.005728	0.053120	0.005254	-0.086368	0.097473	0.163375	-0.066795	-0.014496	-0.370966	-0.074814	0.252643	0.013990	-0.247478	0.153477	-1.085894	-0.087384	-0.028044	-0.333535	-0.156365	0.056032	-0.175405	-0.048192	-0.084106	0.038296	-0.364647	-0.056416	-0.373211	-0.268398	0.373126	0.124702
music	"Enya is in a class all by herself.  She envokes feelings and images that take you out of reality.  So many others have copied her sound (ala James Horner in TITANIC) that it's easy to see how much of an influence she has been.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a classic album.  From the emotional first track instrumental to the enchanting &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, Enya has created a pallete of wonderful pastimes and tragic metaphores here.  Yes, I would consider this pop/new age music.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  There are a number of people that don't like Enya.  There are jokes on South Park about her.  And that's good.  It shows how much of a musical force she is.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a good collection of material from a very important artist, who I hope will never give up her love of music."	4	-0.076312	0.284622	0.378709	-0.119167	0.106033	0.199239	-0.118221	0.006482	-0.029791	-0.067825	0.020658	-0.042356	0.045137	-0.005457	0.170275	-0.137407	0.257419	0.129386	-0.195899	0.456727	0.206956	-0.051986	0.219703	-0.173771	0.152632	0.028810	-0.077679	-0.361249	0.150847	-0.131838	-0.106183	0.345221	-0.039792	0.099600	0.037553	0.057384	0.002651	0.172761	-0.059674	-0.326892	-0.246872	-0.030696	0.017192	-0.070946	-0.074234	-0.081646	0.127891	-0.217916	0.066133	-0.550164	0.037899	-0.131894	0.200302	0.678712	-0.011317	-2.015542	-0.014796	-0.001213	1.094939	0.357640	0.004987	0.925143	-0.186428	-0.028222	0.601654	-0.086554	0.516472	0.172478	0.131937	-0.284812	0.023388	-0.031195	0.017188	-0.186755	0.162635	0.133715	0.034193	-0.050211	-0.462471	-0.103209	0.241519	-0.032107	-0.135618	0.111759	-1.209803	-0.073672	-0.086833	-0.244513	-0.290594	-0.214809	-0.076060	-0.120317	0.028422	0.026399	-0.381320	-0.108721	-0.394261	-0.430753	0.325267	0.303985
music	"The Memory Of Trees begins with the stunning titletrack, a great mix of voices and instrumental sounds, this is one of Enya's best songs. Anywhere Is has a great rythm and is catchy. Pax Deorum is a latin song and very haunting. It's like you're in a storm finding a place to schelter. The fourth song is Athair Ar Neamh; it's sung in Gaelic, I think. I see that it means &quot;Father In Heaven&quot;. Thank you other Amazon reviewer! From Where I Am is an instrumental track and it sort of lulls you to sleep. Then there is China Roses, a very romantic song about a dreamlike world, a sort of dream, I think. Hope Has A Place is another highlight of this record. Just great lyrics, and a soothing atmosphere. Thea House Moon is another instrumental track. It's not my favourite track, but still good. Track number nine is Once You Had Gold. Listen carefully to the lyrics again, just magic. La Sonadora is a spooky ballad, sung in Spanish? I don't know, but another highlight of The Memory Of Trees. And then there is the final track, On My Way Home. On Paint The Sky With Stars.. The Best Of Enya, you can hear the edited version. This one is longer and much more beautiful. A great ending to one of the best cd's ever made!"	4	-0.072709	0.256289	0.411693	-0.101172	0.210169	0.247083	-0.089396	0.010692	-0.100155	-0.115011	0.131338	0.004455	0.040441	-0.022979	0.066337	-0.068912	0.181055	0.062165	-0.106033	0.334852	0.285493	-0.006741	0.056995	-0.086385	0.180666	0.087987	-0.182067	-0.202888	0.211057	-0.100846	-0.214030	0.173412	0.069071	0.115729	0.051148	0.085445	-0.114793	0.159268	0.005386	-0.351115	-0.100621	0.003372	0.040246	-0.001821	0.056179	-0.077558	0.077806	-0.264862	0.065640	-0.588561	-0.050856	-0.045367	0.209251	0.640116	0.013032	-1.921681	-0.013301	0.244693	0.875609	0.330834	-0.050443	0.775731	-0.263843	-0.091924	0.524262	-0.084314	0.386501	0.196219	0.079677	-0.364010	0.052858	0.070148	0.044419	-0.122086	0.137016	0.199610	-0.025304	-0.135594	-0.232557	-0.163111	0.213811	-0.068603	-0.204158	0.087539	-1.036787	-0.005371	-0.102481	-0.261826	-0.070834	0.016061	-0.087404	0.063235	-0.100142	0.079977	-0.290823	-0.145057	-0.463771	-0.280943	0.254971	0.258797
music	"In 1994, the R&B; market was cluttered with girl groups in the likes of SWV, Xscape, TLC, En Vogue, Zhane, and Jade. Despite stiff competition, Changing Faces, a duo of New York songstresses, attained commerical success with their self-titled debut. This was due mainly to the superb lead single ""Stroke U Up"" (platinum single sales) and the follow-up ""Foolin' Around"", each produced by R. Kelly. In addition, both singers were capable vocalists, as displayed by interchangeable lead throughout the set.Not only were the singles well-crafted, but the rest of the album held it own as well. Other highlights include: ""Keep It Right There"" (remix featured on White's Man Burden), ""Come Closer"" (smooth production and smoky vocals), ""Baby Your Love"" (midtempo treat/2nd favorite track), ""Good Thing"" (late-night sleeper) and ""All Is Not Gone"" (syrupy ballad/favorite track).In sum, Changing Faces turned out an excellent record in the midst of the cluttered girl group market. Even though their debut was commercially successful, better records would later turn up for Changing Faces, namely their 3rd set, despite not acheiving the accompanying sales. However, this record is still very good. It has aged well, and continues to get spins from me and radio. A good-buy for the avid R&B; follower.Grade: B+"	4	-0.087004	0.166316	0.322669	-0.115589	0.190959	0.109838	-0.010222	0.068150	-0.181248	0.008818	0.173866	-0.161628	0.141758	0.068853	0.053424	-0.107047	0.126949	0.033561	-0.029859	0.209041	0.280194	-0.005288	0.157446	0.040779	0.180396	0.048483	-0.035941	-0.318954	0.087817	-0.006009	-0.105694	0.253058	-0.034221	0.037793	0.136495	0.163932	-0.010288	0.104438	-0.098048	-0.167582	-0.049890	-0.138766	0.050693	-0.062735	0.071918	-0.113120	0.027039	-0.226396	0.099773	-0.625894	-0.069705	-0.077103	0.065350	0.728806	0.005000	-1.915589	-0.105320	0.021091	1.018485	0.366189	-0.062964	0.529894	-0.244614	0.034336	0.549448	-0.018081	0.354970	0.184136	0.143913	-0.168014	0.013067	-0.012506	-0.163841	-0.051973	0.125731	0.120406	-0.102835	-0.139749	-0.325299	-0.259059	0.328200	0.003979	-0.167266	0.070871	-0.958451	-0.182658	-0.060661	-0.198302	-0.221716	-0.063428	-0.151012	0.013622	-0.068356	0.023732	-0.349474	-0.009917	-0.306809	-0.211232	0.459957	0.117485

music	"In 1994 R. Kelly introduced us to Cassandra Lucas and Charisse Rose, better known as Changing Faces. Their very first single ""Stroke You Up"" had men everywhere saying ""Yes you can."" Then came ""Foolin' Around"", and with songs like that already out, people were wondering when the album was coming out.This album gives you a taste of solid R&B.; Silky ballads like the two aforementioned tracks are accompanied by songs like ""Come Closer"" and ""Keep It Right There"" as well as the two best tracks, ""Thoughts Of You"" and ""All Is Not Gone"". Not one song here is fast-forwardable.The only problem I could really see with this album is the lack of varied subject matter. For example, there are FOUR kick-your-man-to-the-curb songs (""Foolin' Around"", ""Am I Wasting My Time"", ""Movin' On"" and ""Good Thing""). Still, this album is a very good listen. Way to go, ladies!"	4	-0.076256	0.244190	0.391136	-0.303682	0.073042	0.246597	-0.084941	0.067768	-0.114037	-0.133214	0.236746	-0.005043	0.170521	0.102710	0.113341	-0.188880	0.049308	0.167937	-0.214511	0.290684	0.384560	0.095800	0.137477	-0.046345	0.165969	0.122157	-0.121298	-0.379751	0.187306	-0.050876	-0.104097	0.341237	0.085501	0.069728	0.090289	0.203402	-0.014815	0.188162	-0.016759	-0.229928	-0.170977	-0.117464	0.054929	-0.132246	-0.141921	-0.065820	-0.000191	-0.286127	0.043099	-0.685066	0.010687	-0.040592	0.056553	0.836802	-0.138130	-2.060155	0.000577	0.096722	1.172485	0.463647	-0.040074	0.813712	-0.304144	-0.013646	0.675172	0.064192	0.440249	0.186242	0.060287	-0.260801	-0.018013	-0.035657	-0.084344	-0.231429	0.158181	0.147389	-0.106556	-0.113854	-0.389932	-0.191674	0.376570	-0.012315	-0.298280	0.049311	-1.187023	-0.140829	-0.036947	-0.247121	-0.258406	-0.080030	-0.170795	-0.052769	-0.128223	0.042261	-0.431039	-0.051408	-0.336138	-0.246893	0.414573	0.188690

music	"In high school ""Stroke You Up"" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even ""Stroke You Up"" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to ""Changing Faces."" The two chicks who made up ""Changing Faces"" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all.

music	"I first bought the CD-Single of ""Stroke You Up"" back in '94 and the tape when it came out and I wore the tape out until it broke on me. The album is the best and one of the best albums among the girl groups of the mid-90's and were criticized heavily by a lot of people because of one time when they were Video Soul, it sounded like there were lip synching and were labeled as ""studio singers"". No matter what this group could sing to me and had a string of three very good hits. The first two singles were ""Stroke You Up"" & ""Foolin' Around"" which were produced by R. Kelly and the third single was my favorite of the album ""Keep It Right There"" which had the urban touch and produced by one of my favorite producers DeVante. Some other highlights on the album was ""Feeling All This Love"", ""Movin On"", ""Thoughts of You"" & ""Baby Your Love""(Produced by Heavy D). Overall this is a great album with a great soultry mix. This group may not have been in the class of EnVogue & Jade as far as vocals but they can still hold their own."	4	-0.094670	0.214698	0.320539	-0.257763	0.207428	0.239050	0.059058	0.029539	-0.184540	-0.062062	0.240297	-0.056386	0.114698	0.110714	0.065023	-0.103722	0.084002	0.045822	-0.074015	0.263455	0.430090	0.016839	0.141251	-0.009513	0.210353	0.036288	-0.044256	-0.288729	0.257480	0.002863	-0.033019	0.328097	0.076485	0.199584	0.089060	0.162591	-0.029706	0.262443	-0.021353	-0.222121	-0.101274	-0.071331	0.081028	-0.029170	0.001276	-0.135189	-0.051469	-0.264576	0.108239	-0.615234	-0.185630	-0.019278	0.014534	0.741218	-0.075592	-2.106893	-0.109564	0.081045	1.119457	0.519564	0.058668	0.774478	-0.257637	0.083802	0.543271	-0.011440	0.457983	0.222197	0.059269	-0.212215	-0.041757	0.088471	-0.100782	-0.047183	0.089002	0.273795	-0.123432	-0.182879	-0.360568	-0.170512	0.330241	0.002207	-0.174389	0.093770	-1.160490	-0.179918	-0.048499	-0.220170	-0.222317	0.008933	-0.185365	-0.047120	-0.136746	0.009569	-0.433672	-0.041873	-0.375065	-0.226680	0.452904	0.085969
music	"This album was released during an era where slow jams were in and giving up-tempo R&B flavor a try was also in. Like many of their counterparts during that time, the pretty ladies of Changing Faces needed to realize their strength in ballads and avoided trying any up-tempo material. However, there are a couple of good tunes on this album, particularly the slow jam, ""All Is Not Gone"", where sorrow and regret serves as a theme for a song that was definitely written with the intent of winning over ones with heartbreaks in their history. R. Kelly-produced hit ""Stroke You Up"" was a radio smash, but the lyrics weren't exactly poetic or articulate. But, it's still a popular track that may bring back some old school nostalgia for some of you."	4	-0.116180	0.172322	0.332767	-0.195241	0.097211	0.246247	-0.079520	-0.036789	-0.114159	0.018282	0.119360	-0.085821	0.021155	0.092841	0.066387	-0.133016	0.012771	0.058786	-0.154308	0.299347	0.399463	0.051208	0.105864	-0.076832	0.086748	0.116385	-0.141028	-0.308838	0.181831	-0.048105	-0.156511	0.331886	-0.031416	0.067291	0.014920	0.146185	0.031848	0.102417	-0.111661	-0.223224	-0.147361	-0.111180	0.023257	-0.097754	-0.072548	-0.089608	0.169773	-0.283334	0.164505	-0.690018	0.002220	-0.078308	0.130515	0.754331	0.024470	-1.918473	-0.084823	0.114518	1.085316	0.481506	-0.018640	0.687224	-0.328595	-0.029842	0.580768	-0.056389	0.428926	0.165739	0.062400	-0.289286	0.008617	-0.040859	-0.090844	-0.161542	0.129047	0.201963	-0.100205	-0.029481	-0.335851	-0.139868	0.222843	-0.037553	-0.261599	0.083435	-1.176950	-0.082287	-0.098359	-0.195648	-0.353421	-0.057677	-0.132314	0.047702	-0.200266	0.017168	-0.398407	-0.087034	-0.333807	-0.318005	0.356944	0.232783
music	"Changing Faces' recording career was off to a good start with this self-titled debut album. The name Changing Faces alluded to changing trends in 1990s R&B, which was moving away from new jack swing and toward a softer type of medium-tempo groove. In fact, pretty much everything on this CD, favors a medium tempo sound-- the New York duo doesn't overwhelm the listener with either slow ballads or fast material. Cassandra Lucas and Charisse Rose, collectively Changing Faces, are strong singers -- and while slow jams like ""Thoughts of You,"" ""Movin' On,"" and ""Come Closer"" aren't mind-blowing, they're pleasant enough. Not surprisingly, ""Foolin' Around"" and ""Stroke You Up"" (both written and produced by R. Kelly) became major hits."	4	-0.129205	0.154797	0.317480	-0.130717	0.129707	0.138931	-0.075201	-0.020659	-0.184609	-0.015461	0.088404	-0.167251	-0.004153	0.029616	0.166633	-0.187739	-0.013641	0.091539	0.052331	0.229089	0.305549	0.077395	0.129094	-0.056824	0.127459	0.136278	-0.112898	-0.321121	0.049697	0.069085	-0.133194	0.313293	-0.060108	0.021497	0.038914	0.032487	0.048096	-0.047027	-0.070454	-0.197717	-0.131405	-0.186767	0.005790	-0.025397	-0.096123	-0.112876	0.077878	-0.195571	0.174999	-0.633718	0.044831	0.001608	0.092108	0.680935	0.012591	-1.806842	-0.006901	0.100362	0.998868	0.369480	-0.002960	0.668915	-0.311486	0.018922	0.508268	0.012590	0.395352	0.126149	0.106708	-0.179195	0.006737	0.004478	-0.160995	-0.222484	0.179946	0.008470	-0.105681	-0.080292	-0.163394	-0.200603	0.240874	-0.022164	-0.292823	0.077940	-1.010811	-0.145672	-0.028577	-0.266158	-0.314131	-0.107247	-0.168785	0.045182	-0.156534	-0.013331	-0.292055	-0.039680	-0.319757	-0.227304	0.440962	0.185581

I only wish I could find the remix for ""Feeling All This Luv"".  I bought the cd for that song but it's jus the album cut.  I had it on the cassette single for Foolin Around.

music	"The band's first album remains, in my eyes, the best - the songwriting and production are top-notch, and although the lyrics are typically oblique (&quot;You get the diplomatic treatment/You get the force-fed  future&quot;), the songs are performed and sung with such skill that you  tend not to notice.  An excellent combination of various styles -  post-punk, new wave, power pop - it says a lot that both classic rock radio  and alternative radio lay claim to the Cars.  My favorites are &quot;Bye  Bye Love&quot;, &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; and &quot;All Mixed  Up&quot;, but even songs I didn't particularly like (&quot;I'm in Touch  With Your World&quot;) have grown on me.

music	"This is one of those very special albums/now CD's that can be counted on to always generate a happy smile to my face.  I saw the Cars (dig this...it should be ""the other way around,"" huh?) ""open"" for Foreigner in '78.  For reasons that are not relevant here, I have to admit that that concert experience was right up there with seeing Ian Hunter up close or seeing the Stones in '75.  Well, my band already did ""Just What I Needed"" (which was difficult to perform without that all-important synth line).  Still.  On one of the very greatest nights of my life, my best friend/guitarist and our lady singer decided that they had had ENOUGH of my ""pain,"" my ""angst,"" whatever, due to a divorce earlier that year.  I was at work at a most ostentatious clothing store, and I wouldn't get off till 9:30,  But regardless I received a phone call from Kent, telling me ""he and the lady had broken into my apartment, where did I hide the g**ja, and to find y'self a date there, we're takin' you out dancin', we're tired of you whinin' all the time.""  I did, the beautiful red-headed lady security person agreed, and...To make a long story short(er), I ""got up"" for a second, and when I returned the band was just finishing Segar's ""Sunspot Baby.""  The beautiful security lady sat there with a delicious ""come hither"" look about her.  We danced, and (YES!) ""Baby"" segued right IN to ""Fire Down Below.""  A more appropriate song was never written.  But, as to say, ""This Is YO' Nite,Chaz Turner!,"" the band concluded with the Cars' most ethereal ""Let The Good Times Roll.""  As I wrote in a paper for a ""psych 101"" class a couple of years later, ""I won't embellish the story with pornographic details.""

music	"For the most part, The Cars were a singles band, but their debut stands as one of the best ever new wave albums.  The hit songs were solid, including the amazing threesome, &quot;Let the Good Times Roll,&quot; &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; and &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; that kick off the album.  But side two is were The Cars demonstrate their artistic complexity, particularly on the lengthy double track &quot;Moving in Stereo/All Mixed Up.&quot;  &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; make for another couple of great singles as well.  This album is so good, it could stand as a greatest hits package all on its own."	4	-0.076795	0.230653	0.371706	-0.242517	0.182113	0.150283	0.036473	0.088261	-0.277465	-0.014011	0.289944	-0.097418	0.085932	0.145150	0.035216	-0.075001	0.148663	0.155471	-0.180111	0.385140	0.424525	0.068396	0.064607	-0.004727	0.270855	0.005046	-0.075330	-0.312389	0.261440	-0.059640	-0.163309	0.375569	0.031750	0.155190	0.219988	0.141525	-0.098151	0.181049	-0.106968	-0.226698	-0.039874	-0.072080	0.121284	-0.094947	0.064049	-0.083481	0.084019	-0.356673	0.106516	-0.684864	-0.159167	-0.065312	0.024236	0.819553	0.030085	-2.190743	-0.029918	0.124661	1.194017	0.520581	-0.087037	0.808382	-0.374505	0.069327	0.640810	-0.120368	0.379968	0.189445	0.050564	-0.388133	-0.010068	0.026639	-0.065525	-0.113037	0.172586	0.305156	-0.141748	-0.148017	-0.341367	-0.197983	0.440368	0.099814	-0.146533	0.061410	-1.172037	-0.201958	-0.004340	-0.308842	-0.296542	-0.121437	-0.179397	0.016930	-0.190247	-0.008476	-0.474578	-0.052504	-0.402189	-0.175624	0.541364	0.240933
music	"Many bands have a long time to perfect the songs for their first album resulting in a solid debut. This may be the case for The Cars (although Candy-O is great too). This album contains classic songs like Just What I Needed, You're All I've Got Tonight, Bye Bye Love, and Moving In Stereo. It's a crime that this band never got the credit they deserved. They created catchy, sometimes quirky, rock songs with a good balance between rockin guitar and cool keyboards. Elliot Easton's guitar playing is superb as he always plays for the song and not just to show-off. The vocal phrasing of Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr (rest in peace) is excellent (even if I didn't always understand the lyrics). A classic album that must never be forgotten!"	4	-0.128843	0.195708	0.321705	-0.383252	0.112988	0.221278	0.003684	0.040295	-0.158954	-0.127158	0.161067	-0.102905	-0.002762	0.203668	0.069791	-0.101930	0.146892	0.083263	-0.040361	0.352751	0.336940	0.027542	0.100150	-0.156476	0.218961	0.125222	-0.209093	-0.332813	0.317440	-0.064628	-0.146446	0.387055	-0.016187	0.173884	0.108188	0.065131	0.034021	0.155966	-0.028211	-0.407043	0.051252	-0.009246	0.037405	0.035829	-0.078537	-0.118646	0.021776	-0.267117	0.206503	-0.662955	-0.110769	-0.004862	0.105755	0.534489	0.028550	-1.968729	0.003050	0.103820	0.784772	0.427251	0.049304	0.770025	-0.420220	-0.051460	0.600418	-0.141570	0.466143	0.152680	0.016477	-0.317392	-0.027055	0.050714	0.006468	-0.093891	0.113219	0.181704	-0.099681	-0.081817	-0.193096	-0.144193	0.234540	-0.108312	-0.222640	-0.001329	-1.136460	-0.045288	-0.062097	-0.357398	-0.333428	0.008157	-0.237871	-0.040616	-0.160136	0.113786	-0.324024	-0.069553	-0.514662	-0.227506	0.323909	0.269037

music	I originally had the Cars debut on 8track twenty something years ago--The tape pulled out (remember how 8 tracks did that?) so I bought the record album--after playing it soooo many times I was able to see through it--I  went and bought the cassette--needless to say--I wore it out too. I now  have the CD and am trying my hardest to wear it out. The format may wear  out but great tunes never die--I must have listened to the Cars debut album  over a thousand times--it's still great.

Three big hit singles ""Good Times Roll"",""Just What I Needed"", and ""My Bestfriend's Girl"". As well as ""Bye, Bye Love"", ""Moving in Stereo"", and ""YOu're All I've Got Tonight"" that each get a lot of radio play as well.

music	"The music magazine Q recently compiled a list of the 100 best debut albums ever.  The Car's debut was NOT on that list.  It was, however, on the Top 10 Debuts We Love To Hate list.  From my standpoint, they were in good company among artist such as Queen, Dire Straits and Boston.  Being a British magazine, Q may have simply missed the influence this album generated since it wasn't that big in the UK (#29).  My Best Friend's Girl (#3) became a major hit but in great part due to the single being among the first singles (if not the very first) released as a picture disc (shaped like a car).  Just What I Needed (#17) barely crawled into the top 20 and that was practically it for the Cars until they stroke gold internationally with songs from their Heartbeat City album.In the States this album would hardly be treated similar compilations.  My Best Friend's Girl (#27), Just What I Needed (#35) & Good Times Roll (#41) became radio staples and really much more popular than their Billboard top 100 rankings indicate.  During its release it was still common on late night radio shows to play whole sides.  The three songs already being hits on side A, side B became a popular choice for such occasions.  The album didn't set the charts on fire, barely sneaking in the top 20 (#18).  With continuous airplay of many of the album's tracks sales were consistent, which in the States matters much more than in most other territories.  It wound up being among the top 30 sellers of the decade, selling 6 million copies, an incredible achievement for an album not even close to cracking the top 10.  The Cars, both band and album, thus became huge in the States.There are a few things special about this album.  At the time of its release, 1978, its producer, Roy Thomas Baker, was in huge demand, mainly due to his work with Queen.  With Queen, the production was full of sound effects and bombastic vocalizations (Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example).  The production on The Cars is, however, sparse on most of the album (the intros of My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed are especially good examples).  This made the use of synthesiser more prominent in a sense.  The texts were filled with Ric Ocasek's irony which he delivered in a dead panned way; along with the late Benjamin Orr's more emotional approach in singing.  In between this sparse production came forceful harmonies, e.g. on You're All I've Got Tonight and Good Times Roll.  Combined, this gave the Cars a punkish feel, what today would be labelled as post-punk rock.  This sounded very fresh from the typical rock sound which at that point dominated the airwaves as some kind of alternative to balance the popularity of disco.Actually, it is remarkable how fresh the music still sounds today, more than 25 years after its release.  Many groups today are basically doing similar things but now it is viewed as being retro.  There is, however, one major drawback on buying this CD (meaning 4 instead of 5 stars).  The sound quality is below par, which becomes more evident listening to their Just What I Needed Anthology.  Despite being 10 years old, the re-mastering job on that release draws forth the sloppy transfer to CD.  The sound is very low although not being muddled as many other badly transferred records.  This album really could use some re-mastering (there is one available, a deluxe version from 1990 with an extra demo disc; there have, however, been many albums re-mastered originally released later with clearly audible results so that version does not cut it in my books).  Given the sonic achievements that have been done with old Queen releases (the recent 30th anniversary edition of A Night at the Opera could have been recorded yesterday), this album should have tremendous potential in being a major re-release.  Not only would a re-mastering job be welcome but a hybrid SACD version would have the potential of making these classics fresher than ever.Ric, are you reading this?!"	4	-0.107688	0.141209	0.304363	-0.141666	0.234146	0.079814	0.055836	0.019416	-0.101174	-0.011585	0.177053	-0.121775	0.134583	0.025544	0.066980	-0.103088	0.159791	-0.003582	-0.081133	0.255280	0.304584	-0.042723	0.101037	-0.033515	0.158683	-0.076119	0.002045	-0.279131	0.182920	0.003711	-0.030061	0.302236	-0.096296	0.158709	0.061061	0.186430	-0.053209	0.107624	-0.139726	-0.244107	-0.119364	-0.103587	0.073905	0.021048	0.067990	-0.125243	0.108385	-0.302694	0.121853	-0.615565	-0.006630	-0.090327	0.068690	0.718924	-0.052578	-1.958211	-0.109447	-0.012816	1.127160	0.439064	-0.043404	0.673878	-0.297559	0.045325	0.587198	-0.095548	0.303133	0.148375	0.159229	-0.231198	0.015936	0.008311	-0.077754	-0.026398	0.087158	0.171471	-0.068176	-0.049878	-0.486175	-0.171485	0.364467	-0.057396	-0.209213	0.076405	-1.079113	-0.167067	0.010047	-0.303461	-0.205131	-0.114150	-0.097039	-0.042433	-0.185804	0.068792	-0.450358	-0.015563	-0.321798	-0.190059	0.451867	0.116672

The catchy hooks and memorable melodies still sound amazingly fresh over 25 years later, making the Cars one of the few new-wave acts whose work has truly stood the test of time.Like Boston's self-titled debut album which appeared 2 years earlier, this plays like a greatest hits album. The first three tracks &quot;Good Times Roll&quot;, &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot;, and &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; were all big hits and are now bonafide new-wave classics. Although not a big hit, &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; with its simple, yet memorable riff and David Robinson's busy drumming remains one of their most enduring tracks. Other excellent tracks include the punk-pop of &quot;Don't Cha Stop&quot;, the hypnotic &quot;Moving In Stereo&quot;, the moody &quot;All Mixed Up&quot;, and the catchy &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot; The band's ability to play to the strength of the song is admirable here, whether it's guitarist Elliot Easton's excellent lead work on &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot;, Greg Hawkes' keyboard flourishes on &quot;I'm In Touch With Your World&quot;, or Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr's strong vocals throughout the album. An excellent debut. Highly recommended."	4	-0.130127	0.157686	0.293323	-0.306923	0.200833	0.164715	0.015763	0.022259	-0.222828	-0.039687	0.213481	-0.159969	0.075684	0.128176	0.090606	-0.103580	0.182623	0.049735	-0.043885	0.357007	0.423003	0.045241	0.079650	-0.083969	0.252460	0.011900	-0.062702	-0.267656	0.212751	0.038493	-0.126806	0.329669	-0.041895	0.248375	0.042699	0.069221	-0.064739	0.108484	-0.062126	-0.293643	-0.036510	0.003940	0.049825	0.018874	0.035342	-0.084900	0.085519	-0.352112	0.167840	-0.611901	-0.115858	-0.068877	0.112945	0.594350	0.025398	-2.004362	-0.057588	0.075031	0.967248	0.467756	-0.018193	0.718101	-0.298120	0.051557	0.560383	-0.120991	0.366394	0.157735	0.094281	-0.262668	-0.030921	0.047163	-0.124929	-0.106902	0.126365	0.128991	-0.063016	-0.076291	-0.348556	-0.254887	0.345654	-0.041207	-0.202694	0.066946	-1.061661	-0.113273	-0.023544	-0.298115	-0.324970	-0.084981	-0.143081	0.001060	-0.171250	0.080748	-0.399094	-0.017023	-0.481760	-0.256010	0.391807	0.250985
music	"In my view, this album by itself represents the birth of New Wave (that is, before it had a name).  When the Cars released this, their first, there simply was no other sound like it--and it would take years before other artists even came close to reproducing the cool, beat-laden, tech-heavy resonances of such songs as Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, Just What I needed, You're All I've Got Tonight, and the terrific combination of Moving in Stereo and All Mixed Up.  In short, mock all you want the haircuts and vapid lyrics of the boy bands which came later, but this one is real, hard, and as original as it gets."	4	-0.069517	0.222995	0.340506	-0.283085	0.073460	0.158123	-0.029529	0.052187	-0.164126	0.041281	0.123673	-0.054063	0.106286	0.078210	0.166047	-0.134601	0.119047	0.025391	-0.145550	0.296563	0.316383	0.001364	0.108169	-0.033922	0.203425	0.005426	-0.146579	-0.358018	0.168400	-0.052364	-0.025888	0.419616	-0.098433	0.149455	0.101428	0.115784	-0.042003	0.092961	0.043076	-0.288529	-0.163595	-0.172197	0.015606	-0.131936	-0.091905	-0.103768	0.083475	-0.209175	0.180272	-0.679487	-0.070426	-0.039694	0.164839	0.816381	-0.087969	-2.133494	-0.057306	0.041172	1.183632	0.419398	-0.022779	0.836149	-0.344971	0.039559	0.645212	-0.095067	0.454205	0.219068	0.058472	-0.238796	-0.019827	-0.110135	-0.078444	-0.190483	0.102184	0.168125	-0.057364	-0.086191	-0.459263	-0.157540	0.386238	-0.052987	-0.320433	0.036942	-1.170621	-0.188348	0.035725	-0.282648	-0.204481	-0.214682	-0.052287	-0.056354	-0.141604	0.025906	-0.465946	-0.062939	-0.396325	-0.197600	0.423310	0.158398
music	"The Cars was one of the most original bands to come out of the late 70s/early 80s, a band that helped set the yardstick for New Wave. This was their first album, coming out in 1978, and is in my humble opinion to be the best album that the band cut. Just about all of its tracks are great, and not just the hits ""Just What I Needed,"" ""My Best Friend's Girl"" and ""Good Times Roll.""If you are a fan of New Wave music, then you will love this album. Heck, even if is just that you fondly remember the music of the late 70s/early 80s, then you will love this album, too.

music	"""Just What I Needed"" was already an oldie by the time I was a high school sophomore, but that didn't stop it from being one of the most relevant songs I could get my hands on. It simultaneously fulfilled all of my most pertinent musical cravings, serving up a flawless three-and-a-half-minute cocktail of crunching power chord heroics, sharp melodic hooks, hopelessly clever lyrics, and vocals that were both quirky and impassioned. It was the perfect pop song, but with enough spiky alt-new wave attitude to imbue it with a sense of genuine cool. Every time I cue it up, it takes me back to tenth grade, to that joyful year that saw me fall helplessly in love with my best friend. ""Just What I Needed"" is the sound of pure, hopeless joy, of butterflies in the stomach and lightness in the head, of wry, knowing angst and cheekily self-deprecating humor. It's the sound of smart people letting their emotions sneak up on them. Beautiful!But the most mind-boggling thing about ""Just What I Needed"" is that it's not even my favorite song here! That honor would probably go to ""Bye Bye Love,"" which is a brittle, cynical masterpiece. It's a simple breakup song that somehow manages to turn the whole notion of love inside out, and every one of its hooks is stuffed with bitterness and paranoia and caustic wit. In fact, I'd say that this album is worth the price of admission purely on the basis of Ric Ocasek sneering ""you think you're so illustrious/ you call yourself intense."" It's one of the most withering putdowns in the history of pop music, rivaling even the more acidic moments of This Year's Model and Highway 61 Revisited.The other seven songs are icing on the cake. I love icing. There are sweet, gooey gobs of it all over this disc, in the form of such irresistible classics as ""My Best Friend's Girl"" and ""Don't Cha Stop."" ""I'm In Touch With Your World"" is marvelously quirky, and ""Moving In Stereo"" is endearingly creepy. ""You're All I've Got Tonight"" is desperate and paranoid and surprisingly fun, ""Good Times Roll"" is a panicked (anti-) party anthem, and ""All Mixed Up"" is really atmospheric and kinda sultry. And the chorus is beautiful, sort of. Yeah. This album'll blow your mind with its inescapable wonderfulness. Treat yourself to it."	4	-0.057345	0.227788	0.407461	-0.240654	-0.030086	0.368596	-0.054126	0.038928	-0.053959	0.026671	0.085196	0.023583	0.048512	0.035728	0.176693	-0.065905	-0.012633	0.106751	-0.094737	0.264169	0.295256	0.084908	0.037425	-0.197608	0.237002	0.156820	-0.154062	-0.219273	0.191336	-0.197599	-0.127944	0.316925	0.016354	0.008888	-0.019627	0.128110	-0.060637	0.097708	0.060989	-0.287966	-0.059457	-0.065022	-0.015511	-0.165497	-0.121585	-0.038021	0.099236	-0.144583	0.069011	-0.551527	-0.015906	-0.096654	0.164698	0.639138	-0.071922	-1.652463	0.150795	0.110762	0.901034	0.233391	0.085188	0.704556	-0.311046	-0.012069	0.457753	-0.082459	0.488368	0.090533	-0.003810	-0.312042	0.044716	-0.078489	0.008978	-0.105975	0.064964	0.226630	-0.144912	-0.128453	-0.304134	-0.133665	0.229489	-0.015919	-0.245029	0.088344	-1.041822	-0.122209	0.020630	-0.099489	-0.277341	-0.206644	-0.098100	0.076593	-0.117381	0.056023	-0.312671	-0.097029	-0.291250	-0.302394	0.211291	0.347135
music	"The Cars hit a formula right from the very start.  With Ric Ocasek generally taking the lead vocal, The Cars combined wonderfully wordsmithed lyrics with a solid rock beat to become one of the best New Wave groups.  Some people have argued that The Cars, along with Devo and several other groups, created New Wave.This album is a remarkable debut, with three of the songs released as singles and three others released as flipsides for a incredible 6 of 9 songs appearing as singles - something that few other groups have managed to achieve.  The songs are: ""Just What I Needed""/""I'm in Touch with Your World"" (5/29/78), ""Best Friend's Girl""/""Don't Cha Stop"" (10/10/78), and ""Good Times Roll""/""All Mixed Up"" (2/27/79).I've always had a great appreciation for The Cars' lyrics.  They are typically artfully evocative and more intended to evoke emotion than to convey a concept directly.  As an example, look at the opening lyrics of ""All Mixed Up"":she shadows me in the mirrorshe never leaves on the lightand some things that I say to herthey just don't seem to biteWhen you read The Cars' (typically Ric Ocasek's) lyrics you feel surrealistic.  Once you understand you are to picture images of feelings, or feel the feelings yourself, you gain an understanding of how the singer/songwriter is feeling.The Cars insisted they are music performers and not an ""act"", preferring to be known for their music rather than their ability to look flashy or jump around on stage.  Fortunately for us, the listeners, that desire translates into musical quality and sincerity.  This music has a pop feel to it, but with enough of a hard edge that pushes it towards the boundary between pop and hard rock.The musical style is somewhat dated, feeling like the late 70s music that it is, but it has aged to the point where it is now classic rock.  This CD is very solid music for anyone a fan of The Cars, of late 70s or 80s music, or anyone looking for something a bit out of the mainstream that has a good solid rock beat."	4	-0.079913	0.264423	0.305238	-0.156524	0.133940	0.259461	-0.112645	0.013950	-0.146134	0.005565	0.167064	-0.108959	0.091134	-0.000273	0.114175	-0.116018	0.037761	0.096347	-0.161956	0.361501	0.391590	0.044386	0.137192	-0.115065	0.133152	-0.011302	-0.047155	-0.341404	0.286534	-0.081595	-0.071418	0.414173	-0.143492	0.086409	0.073603	0.083170	0.066043	0.126573	-0.067369	-0.240212	-0.115946	-0.155550	-0.021905	-0.051848	-0.077355	-0.156432	0.091282	-0.191912	0.087727	-0.681964	-0.034485	-0.067840	0.097907	0.729532	-0.020719	-1.959850	-0.098273	0.065503	1.128191	0.409040	0.012589	0.786805	-0.315665	0.028981	0.552677	-0.033015	0.440284	0.136907	0.064113	-0.290180	-0.029409	-0.054026	-0.070446	-0.122639	0.114961	0.151627	-0.026320	-0.080555	-0.323214	-0.238896	0.274840	-0.007060	-0.249173	0.055667	-1.078991	-0.141423	-0.098213	-0.228154	-0.280364	-0.096257	-0.104205	-0.031453	-0.153943	0.033681	-0.405314	-0.039584	-0.473644	-0.294428	0.419308	0.242804
music	"It's ridiculous how many bands nowadays blatantly rip off the Cars without anyone calling them on their crap.  ""Stacy's Mom,"" anyone?  Weezer or Hot Hot Heat, perhaps?The reason for all of this idolatry is, of course, because the Cars' debut album is still one of the freshest and most vital pop albums ever.  The record was released in 1978, and it never ceases to amaze me with just how timelessly perfect it still sounds.With simple, catchy, and infinitely memorable songs, the Cars' debut is the official soundtrack to a good time.  Easily one of the 70s' best.  ""Just What I Needed"" is among my top five favorite pop songs ever."	4	-0.152133	0.163711	0.468264	-0.260374	0.191614	0.277894	0.062727	0.046602	0.003349	0.021634	0.312735	-0.061660	0.094256	0.035582	0.096719	-0.131241	0.102046	0.148862	-0.028626	0.377646	0.352654	0.103660	0.138804	-0.156100	0.179104	0.066296	-0.106324	-0.321042	0.242001	-0.097284	-0.054083	0.306957	-0.039206	0.173546	0.073419	0.165051	-0.140520	-0.009729	-0.091729	-0.343192	-0.026881	0.058100	0.033772	-0.039942	0.032206	-0.111170	0.184231	-0.278882	0.058544	-0.673770	0.011496	-0.110949	0.077135	0.666077	-0.015853	-1.783089	-0.030899	0.210031	0.942789	0.399863	-0.084825	0.713074	-0.217202	0.052523	0.608882	-0.063847	0.469095	0.079185	0.060324	-0.361667	-0.007735	-0.072060	-0.038295	0.046984	0.110404	0.224369	-0.069856	-0.206276	-0.280969	-0.182632	0.357491	-0.045246	-0.280685	0.091801	-1.011628	-0.114734	-0.086510	-0.221822	-0.199144	-0.067168	-0.130282	0.094373	-0.152998	-0.062183	-0.409808	-0.076512	-0.488347	-0.148521	0.357147	0.282411
music	"Strong debut for the Boston post-punk/new wave band, fronted by the legendary Ric Ocasek (though bassist Benjamin Orr could almost be considered a ""co-frontman""). Snide charm and effortless hooks dominated this effort, with several deserved hits along the way (and at least a couple more that probably could have been smashes as well). Heavily influenced and influential, its flavor is dulled a bit by time--their fusion of punk/new wave with catchy hard rock is no longer quite as new.""Just What I Needed"" is, of course, the standout of the bunch, but the underrated minor hit ""You're All I've Got Tonight"" is nearly its equal. Meanwhile, the hit track, ""My Best Friend's Girl"" hasn't aged quite as well, but it's got such a goofily fun hook that it's nearly irresistible. Surprisingly, one of the weakest tracks, ""I'm in Touch With Your World,"" is the one that works hardest to stand apart; unfortunately it falls victim to a weak melody and the clich&eacute;s of punchy psychedelia.Best cuts: ""Just What I Needed,"" ""You're All I've Got Tonight,"" ""Good Times Roll,"" ""Moving in Stereo,"" ""Don't Cha Stop,"" ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" ""All Mixed Up"""	4	-0.068381	0.255791	0.332956	-0.317094	-0.015467	0.189071	-0.017854	0.067340	-0.120413	-0.014876	0.161305	-0.040255	0.107118	0.027098	0.103419	-0.162411	-0.032128	-0.003736	-0.168870	0.350909	0.410753	0.136146	0.064824	-0.109904	0.196810	0.022792	-0.172180	-0.380817	0.167771	-0.076705	-0.062435	0.407694	0.026352	0.102368	0.088144	0.066500	-0.118565	0.066473	0.036724	-0.204524	-0.103301	-0.091469	0.071798	-0.160754	-0.030328	-0.039253	0.182542	-0.188404	0.125392	-0.635350	-0.139195	-0.098214	0.083246	0.690687	-0.038019	-1.891833	-0.037914	0.113296	1.026245	0.432612	0.013035	0.732869	-0.302409	0.076015	0.542890	-0.130636	0.434475	0.215049	0.077310	-0.239298	0.000681	-0.079278	-0.062826	-0.109972	0.138101	0.039107	-0.115845	-0.067278	-0.311115	-0.151866	0.308258	0.020906	-0.284496	0.003662	-1.037755	-0.195602	-0.001157	-0.124405	-0.317358	-0.212199	-0.096908	0.020085	-0.112789	0.031794	-0.417826	-0.024847	-0.319655	-0.234200	0.361634	0.291103
music	"For many listeners, it might be hard at this point to listen to The Cars' 1978 debut album with fresh ears.  Over half the songs here remain staples of classic rock radio stations, and even if you don't voluntarily listen to these stations, you're bound to be familiar with songs like ""Just What I Needed"", ""Good Times Roll"", etc.  Even so, this is a great album, well-deserved of its classic status.Don't be fooled by The Cars' tendency to get pegged as a 'singles band'.  This nine-song debut actually has the feel of a song cycle with its uncannily sequenced lineup of songs. One of the great appeals of Ric Ocasek is the playful, yet classy, and savagely witty way in which he wrote about sex, how there's so much more to it than just 'getting laid'--there's a certain desperation mixed with vulnerability in songs like ""Just What I Needed"" and ""You're All I've Got Tonight"".The opening ""Good Times Roll"" sets the scene perfectly, with Ric offering us a feel-good anthem fed through his own warped sensibility.  ""My Best Friend's Girl"" is a wonderfully entertaining 'modernization' of Buddy Holly's patented sound.  ""Don't 'Cha Stop"", with its ""Pleasant Valley Sunday""-ish opening riff, is album's sole uptempo track--the chorus feels rather tossed off, but it's still a very fine track, with great layered guitar lines on the verses.  The ""I Can't Explain""-esque ""Bye Bye Love"" has a very upbeat-sounding tune, but the ominous lyrics and Ben Orr's marvelously stylish vocal delivery help make it the perfect lead-in to the album's final two tracks...""Moving In Stereo"" was cooked up by Ric and Greg Hawkes in Ric's basement, making it the one track on the album Ric didn't write on his own.  And what a classic it is.  David Robinson's drums are tweaked a bit, giving them a noticeably brash quality.  Hawkes offers a synth line that's creepy and defiant without sounding melodramatic.  Perfect vocals from Ben Orr--could this man ever sing.""All Mixed Up"" ends the album in cathartic fashion--great dynamics, sumptuous vocal harmonies, and a stirringly emotional climax with a brilliantly-placed keyboard lick from Hawkes and Ben Orr once again working magic with his powerful, commanding vocals.I also must not fail to mention ""I'm In Touch With Your World"", another 'hidden' gem contained herein.  It shows that Ric could wring a quirky chord progression out of his guitar if he really tried.  Ric delivers an ultra-edgy lead vocal--it has a great, bugs-under-your-skin quality to it.  And all the percussion, sudden blasts of sound effects, and 'tick-tock' synths on the chorus punctuate this mostly stripped-down track marvelously.Lead guitarist Elliot Easton isn't spotlighted as much as he would be on the subsequent ""Candy-O"", but you can hear how the man was a big believer in 'serving the songs'--check out his well-placed rockabilly licks (instantly reminiscent of the Beatles' ""I Will) on ""My Best Friend's Girl"", or his fine, if rather brief, solo on ""Just What I Needed"".So, you may think you know this album all too well already.  But, I suggest perhaps there's a bit more to this than you realize--after all, with a group like The Cars, things are often not as they seem."	4	-0.106814	0.202543	0.327858	-0.315380	0.040817	0.238788	-0.069490	0.089487	-0.093732	-0.055383	0.123139	-0.002901	0.037612	0.079688	0.099653	-0.083057	0.014199	0.067772	-0.090422	0.247722	0.299089	0.013221	0.090627	-0.151522	0.192607	0.070943	-0.177885	-0.257535	0.198878	-0.051104	-0.103143	0.298342	-0.047011	0.103918	0.037295	0.099894	-0.045798	0.113198	-0.007612	-0.275905	-0.034702	-0.081079	0.016311	-0.060771	-0.108338	-0.030792	0.086023	-0.200146	0.109582	-0.640234	-0.053142	-0.055719	0.143593	0.589656	-0.021798	-1.737384	0.010267	0.055024	0.866011	0.336019	0.046213	0.699062	-0.267654	0.028933	0.493378	-0.149618	0.433780	0.177297	0.005512	-0.264893	-0.037829	-0.045235	-0.001721	-0.167996	0.124636	0.106756	-0.074350	-0.080790	-0.247419	-0.175763	0.255607	-0.099826	-0.254503	0.094827	-1.049594	-0.095392	0.033501	-0.179727	-0.305800	-0.087307	-0.120439	-0.004329	-0.131654	0.030221	-0.286220	-0.061046	-0.394305	-0.285430	0.279508	0.283964

music	"This 1978 blend of tuneful pop and power rock has stood the test of time very well. The album contains a magical fusion of the melodicism of pop and the passionate force of rock. The first three tracks: Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed form one of those legendary song cycles, just like the sequence of Dirty-Ass Rock &amp; Roll, Darling I Need You and Rollaroll on John Cale's Slow Dazzle album. But every one of the tracks is excellent, made timeless by their killer hooks, tight harmonies and focused energy. To my mind, The Cars continued the poprock tradition of artists like Queen, Alice Kooper and Roxy Music, whilst there is also a specifically new wave feel about this album that reminds me of an obscure contemporary of theirs, one Mink DeVille, and of course those other famous poprockers Blondie. Of course, Pat Benatar and The Knack mined a similar vein, but they came later. All of the songs were written by Ric Ocasek, no mean feat considering their gripping melodic appeal and lasting popularity on the playlists. This album is one of the best examples of late 70s style rock with a punk attitude."	4	-0.161169	0.200405	0.284902	-0.197622	0.204733	0.221481	-0.009777	-0.010171	-0.233227	0.070443	0.089773	-0.109162	0.035994	0.112356	0.100146	-0.091186	0.166829	-0.018666	-0.019850	0.321871	0.341002	-0.049801	0.060097	-0.182489	0.204997	0.089193	-0.098964	-0.292082	0.244061	-0.038504	-0.119954	0.274536	-0.083743	0.193659	0.025952	0.072407	-0.034438	0.050933	-0.005180	-0.353644	-0.060697	-0.013442	-0.038232	0.103002	-0.082548	-0.093568	0.058525	-0.253626	0.149157	-0.454464	-0.056095	0.013933	0.164931	0.564365	-0.026146	-1.785324	-0.113134	0.111484	0.838534	0.397773	0.072319	0.684976	-0.174101	0.058613	0.637870	-0.140288	0.389549	0.034326	0.148761	-0.336176	-0.039881	0.089926	-0.093820	-0.004203	0.068921	0.066922	-0.005933	-0.146919	-0.230897	-0.221585	0.188378	0.019157	-0.072669	0.089627	-0.881165	-0.058285	-0.068938	-0.291836	-0.267064	-0.075672	-0.145053	-0.022053	-0.194919	0.111488	-0.276957	-0.094031	-0.496486	-0.296615	0.354330	0.207843
music	"Learning to drive was one of the most liberating experiences I have had. It just changed the rules of the game.  I went from being a kid who had to be shuttled around to a more active participant in the world at large.  I not only had a new lease on life but also new responsibilities (a 1990 Honda Civic to take care of - my parents' old car that became mine around 1995 or so) that felt adult-like.  I think I grew a lot overall from the experience and now, many years later, can't imagine what life would be like if I couldn't get behind the wheel.I've always associated driving with liberation and excitement, and to this day it's my best place to think.  I have logged a lot of miles on several vehicles over the years and (wait, I'm reviewing something aren't I?) can think of no better soundtrack for this experience than the first Cars album.This album was released the year after I was born, so I certainly didn't ""grow up with it"" through my formative (read: teenage) years like some of the other reviewers here.  However I've always felt a certain kinship with this little classic, as if it's something that I should (in italics) have grown up with.  Perhaps that's because, for all of its virtues, a lot of the music that came about in ""my"" era wasn't particularly fun and catchy.  Driving to Nirvana or Soundgarden is (IMHO) a soup-sandwich unless you're really angry and/or depressed.  The closest corollary is Teenage Fanclub (another band that has created some of my favorite driving music), Fountains Of Wayne (of course) and Canadian band Sloan.The Cars' first disc is the driving album that every generation ought to have, full of good poppy rockin fun with an ever-so-slightly-twisted perspective (arched eyebrows at the ready) that allows you to still feel smart while singing along.  I couldn't ask for more.  However, absent any discoveries yet to be made, I don't believe there is such a thing for Gen-X and beyond. In the meantime, give this a spin the next time you head out on the road and try to picture that rush of liberation that you may have experienced when you first got behind the wheel unsupervised.

music	"THE BAND: Ric Ocasek (vocals, rhythm guitar), Elliot Easton (lead guitar), Benjamin Orr (vocals, bass), Greg Hawkes (keyboards, percussion, saxophone), David Robinson (drums & percussion).THE DISC: (1978) 9 tracks clocking in at just over 35 minutes. Included with the disc is a minimal 2-page foldout containing song titles/times, band members and original black & white photos/artwork. Digitally remastered in 1990. There is a deluxe remastered 2-disc (disc-2 is all demos) edition released in 1999. Label - Elektra.COMMENTS: The Cars were never better than this debut album. Rock and pop with a synth/techno alternative flavor. Classic songs that sounded like nothing else at the time. The Cars were ""New Wave"" before there was New Wave (which hit in the early 80's). 9 songs - with only one question mark (filler?) in ""I'm In Touch With Your World"". The other 8 tracks were gold (the album reached #18 on the Billboard Pop charts and has sold over 6 million units). Ric Ocasek's quirky voice teamed with bassist Ben Orr's smooth voice worked well together. Greg Hawke on keyboards made & pulled this band tighter. The songs that made it to major air-waves were ""Let The Good Times Roll"", ""My Best Friend's Girl"", and ""Just What I Needed"". But, check out tracks 6-9... ""You're All I've Got Tonight"", ""Bye Bye Love"", ""Moving In Stereo"" and ""All Mixed Up"" run together fluidly - these are awesome album tracks. Sure this band looked like a bunch of geeks, but man when they came together with their instruments, they really made some beautiful music. Only their 2nd album ""Candy-O"" came close, but no album of the Cars was better than this one. This debut is ranked #282 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of 500 all-time greatest albums. R.I.P. Benjamin Orr (10/3/00). Classic disc (5 stars)."	4	-0.162190	0.156962	0.339742	-0.385876	0.277557	0.194009	0.115294	0.076228	-0.190367	-0.054749	0.400249	-0.175868	0.013958	0.175384	0.145446	-0.069793	0.188886	0.007227	-0.092334	0.246627	0.358700	-0.015455	0.155899	0.004166	0.296766	0.035675	0.018238	-0.268394	0.299819	0.026040	-0.091569	0.339191	-0.076114	0.196009	0.018455	0.123309	0.046060	0.180765	0.019263	-0.285264	0.032063	-0.148477	0.011898	0.068119	-0.071674	-0.083259	-0.099774	-0.318830	0.157576	-0.588101	-0.112604	-0.045176	0.043367	0.532534	-0.047653	-1.926685	-0.126381	0.137593	0.902071	0.512971	0.059412	0.695587	-0.328183	0.072202	0.494268	-0.151598	0.349833	0.254783	0.150232	-0.195907	-0.068007	0.129582	-0.085416	-0.047108	0.106806	0.181711	0.013993	-0.031801	-0.233406	-0.260391	0.302716	-0.151388	-0.144088	0.078932	-0.858701	-0.064023	0.054975	-0.378397	-0.216354	0.078084	-0.227898	0.054999	-0.169928	0.079020	-0.375870	-0.091135	-0.443999	-0.189507	0.424745	0.050998
music	"THE CARS (1978) is the The Cars' greatest work ever.  Sure, '80's Top 40 pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY (which did sell more records upon release), but real rock fans rate their debut at the top. Why? Because, just like most great rock debuts (such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN), it shows The Cars in hungry mode, pulling out all the stops to create a hard, edgy, and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time. This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound (that only then was beginning to emerge) in equal amounts, with straightforward, simple lyrics--and created a sound that was raw yet sleek, edgy but commercially accessible, and totally fresh at that time. Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr's similarly cool, unaffected lead vocals, Greg Hawkes' incredibly cool, futuristic keyboards, and Elliot Easton's slicing, awesome guitar-work, this album was truly unique. It influenced countless other New Wave/rock bands afterwards. It has since stood the test of time, and that's what makes it a true classic.When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape 22 years ago, I was already quite familiar with &quot;Just What I Needed.&quot; Then, I really got hooked on &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; and &quot;Best Friend's Girl.&quot; It wasn't until 1982 that I really started liking &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot; The following year, I got into &quot;I'm In Touch With Your World.&quot; But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of &quot;Moving In Stereo/All Mixed Up.&quot; Talk about a true classic; over the years, every now and then, it's given me something new to love about it!

music	"When this album was released, I was the perfect age to receive it. I was a hard core music fan yet bored with hard rock and prog, embarrassed at the disco movement, too naive to appreciate soul and funk, too cool to listen to top 40/bubblegum and too suburban to accept Brittish punk rock. I was hungry for new, cutting edge tunes since Led Zep, Stones, Tull, Kiss and others became soooooooooo stale.Along comes the Cars.Today, the Cars sound so tame and nostalgic but in 1978, this stuff couldn't be any more hip with the reverb soaked detached vocals, synthasized sounding drums, compressed guitars, and adventerous keyboards. I know it must sound hard to believe but ""Just What I Needed"" was a complete breath of fresh air. Everybody (and I mean everybody...even my guitar teacher, famous shred master Michael Angelo Batio) was intrigued by this fresh sound and they were, sorry for the pun, thought of as truly a ""new wave"" of musical talent. In my high school, the cool kids abandoned everything and embraced hippness of The Cars.Now, in hindsight, it is easy to see why the Cars made such a quick impact. These were hardly young kids but, rather, they were seasoned veterans, honing their craft, writing finely composed songs and applying high quality musicianship. Guitarist Elliot Easton was as good of a chicken picker on a Telecaster as anybody, Ric Ocasek was a seasoned songwriter, Keyboard player Greg Hawkes was a session player and drummer Dave Robinson came out of the Modern Lovers. These guys must have studied Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Roxy Music since you can hear the influences everywhere.Their debut has many of their best songs. ""the good times roll"" has all of the above quality ingredients, the aforementioned cool, detached singing, motorizing guitars and in your face keyboard theme. ""My best friend's girl"" changes the pace beautifully mixing new wave with twanging rockabilly. ""Moving in Stereo"" is a hypnotic, groove oriented song. ""You're all I got tonight"" test your speakers by utilizing all the right stereophonic squibs and squalls.Because these guys were so experienced musically, their sound seems to have quickly moved on and matured, which may have been (ironically) to their disadvantage, since, in the end, they sounded like everybody else. Each album lost more of the ""edge"" that attracted me.I think their debut and ""Candy O"" are their best albums since they were the most adventerous."	4	-0.116622	0.232735	0.307165	-0.275424	-0.001347	0.236367	-0.010836	-0.017764	-0.094208	0.008617	0.135971	-0.155373	0.072650	0.080278	0.087029	-0.165599	0.025935	0.069868	-0.039613	0.287520	0.202448	0.051375	0.119915	-0.226324	0.169533	0.097683	-0.153002	-0.300694	0.242918	0.001186	-0.087613	0.359660	-0.078481	0.143016	0.018930	0.058050	-0.039951	0.080223	0.060809	-0.383890	-0.101049	-0.101501	-0.010483	-0.029567	-0.106939	-0.071323	0.041518	-0.144976	0.168947	-0.603122	-0.092725	-0.079556	0.013188	0.522641	0.004731	-1.666479	-0.042057	0.105680	0.848126	0.324754	0.088090	0.710947	-0.286742	0.081352	0.463356	-0.130143	0.440490	0.083286	0.070035	-0.238042	0.022606	0.023897	-0.049982	-0.102841	0.057241	0.122204	-0.026653	-0.048226	-0.116399	-0.203660	0.269367	-0.056800	-0.219485	0.078693	-0.927350	-0.050339	-0.012229	-0.223686	-0.345374	-0.094698	-0.091933	-0.037432	-0.154529	0.052935	-0.321040	-0.073615	-0.433719	-0.203686	0.364465	0.203745
music	"the Cars were a breath of fresh air in 1978.  Disco and sappy pop was the rule in '78, but with this release by these Boston modern rockers, it would lead to a 9 year relationship with this band.

music	"There are precious few flawless albums in rock and roll history.  This is one of them.  Just as Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" singlehandedly turned Grunge into a mainstream phenomenon, so it was for New Wave with the Cars' debut album - And just like Nirvana fostered countless unlistenable imitators, so did the Cars. But I have a choice not to listen to all of the bad New Wave that followed this, and I also have a choice to listen to this impossibly catchy album as long as I have functioning ear drums.For those who are only familiar with the Cars through classic rock radio, this is the Cars CD to get.  It's a rare instance where one of the band's original albums is the first choice over a greatest hits package."	4	-0.136505	0.163289	0.337484	-0.254889	0.269648	0.197421	0.087779	-0.011395	-0.042400	0.055478	0.189388	-0.079211	0.077852	0.113470	0.144643	-0.134916	0.166499	0.046160	0.063985	0.318176	0.412209	-0.012483	0.039134	-0.184474	0.270460	0.013266	-0.083764	-0.230870	0.254788	-0.038568	0.005346	0.305863	-0.133167	0.266475	0.036454	0.101986	-0.007445	0.039899	-0.002593	-0.395392	-0.062548	0.070870	-0.028175	0.079184	-0.008482	-0.119704	0.152154	-0.145078	0.041731	-0.554146	-0.062221	-0.035713	0.041738	0.513156	0.006346	-1.791561	-0.055319	0.201120	1.019811	0.416144	-0.036563	0.739732	-0.198520	0.046444	0.609902	-0.159512	0.347340	-0.034941	0.122958	-0.425308	-0.044142	0.004686	-0.142615	-0.034390	-0.019002	0.129104	0.007815	-0.126046	-0.255187	-0.244173	0.399135	-0.030354	-0.082530	0.153208	-0.950148	-0.028240	-0.034097	-0.377376	-0.342686	-0.041469	-0.010584	0.048814	-0.207920	-0.007451	-0.429589	-0.190697	-0.510072	-0.103475	0.513800	0.205921
music	"The Car's debut album in 1978 represents the good ol' days of American rock. They are categorized as a NEW WAVE artist but to them, they were struggling to create what American rock compared to UK rock should be evolved. With the huge success of Boston, Foreigner, Styx and Kansas they were trying to do something different while retaining mainstream pop vibe. The band challenges Foreigner with hard-edged and upbeat track JUST WHAT I NEEDED. While creating radio friendly first three songs, they were experimenting what music fans at that time might never been experienced. Fourth track I'M IN TOUCH WITH YOUR WORLD invites listeners to the uncharted territories. Then at fifth track they again put out upbeat track DON'T CHA STOP, then they turn to progressive hard rock edged YOU ARE ALL I'VE GOT TONIGHT.

music	"My native Boston based rockers The Cars released their self-titled debut in June of 1978.The Cars was formed by rhythm guitarist/singer/songwriter Ric Ocasek and bass player/singer (the late) Benjamin Orr.Prior to the formation of The Cars, Orr and Ocasek were in a popular Boston act called Cap'n Swing, along with lead guitarist and Berkeley School of Music grad Elliot Easton. They broke up in 1975 and the trio joined forces with former Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson and keyboard player Greg Hawkes in 1976.For a year they did well gigging around New England and their demo of ""Just What I Needed"" became a hugely requested song on a local Boston rock station (WBCN for those who want to know). As a result, Elektra Records signed the band and the label decided to pull out the artillery for this new band and have legendary Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker produce this incredible debut which was recorded in London, England at George Martin's AIR Studios with engineer Geoff Workman (another Queen and Journey veteran).When this album came out, it was a smash and 30 plus years later, it is still a masterpiece.The album's first three tracks were all hit singles. ""Good Times Roll"" is a great opening song on this album with a killer guitar riff and what not. Next is ""My Best Friend's Girl"" is another great song and I think of this song from the 1979 Matt Dillon film debut Over the Edge where he told a cop off as the policeman was arresting one of his friends. The song is great too with a guitar solo reminiscent to The Beatles' ""I Will"" in tone. The song that follows was ""Just What I Needed"" which was America's intro to the band and was Orr's vocal debut on a Cars track (Ben and Ric would split the vocals evenly). The track is still a staple of rock radio. This track too appeared in Over the Edge prior to the film's party scene. ""I'm In Touch With Your World"" and ""Dont'cha Stop"" are also great rockers which close the first half of the album with classic Ric vocals (Ric sang most of the first half except as noted). Those tracks ended the first half wanting more.The rock radio staple ""You're All I've Got Tonight"" kicks the second half off in a grand way and is a killer rocker (the only vocal from Ric in the second half as Ben did the rest). ""Bye Bye Love"" is next and another great rocker as well and a rock radio staple as is most of this album. We segue into the classic ""Moving in Stereo"" which is one of the band's best pieces of music and the song is forever etched in our brains as that image of Phoebe Cates in the red swimsuit coming out of the pool in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The closing ""All Mixed Up"" is a great song as well and a great way to close this album.This album fittingly got the success it deserved and not only did New Wave fans buy and embrace this album in droves but hard rock fans did as well and sold millions and peaked in the US Top 20.This version of the album was remastered in 1998 by Joe Gastwirt and Rhino then upped the anty by issuing a deluxe edition in 1999.Highly recommended!"	4	-0.060483	0.061387	0.302379	-0.329785	0.191553	0.166747	0.087643	0.085685	-0.218311	-0.046031	0.202713	-0.135004	0.033829	0.102565	0.061416	-0.171662	0.245455	-0.053023	-0.130690	0.263333	0.382567	-0.015397	0.109866	-0.031305	0.290999	0.015338	-0.069137	-0.316247	0.344928	0.035130	-0.165637	0.365809	0.021025	0.216287	0.000681	0.064226	-0.011614	0.186240	-0.033507	-0.322700	-0.072168	-0.024577	0.058666	0.046470	0.067962	-0.049551	-0.003272	-0.343155	0.198051	-0.550718	-0.127378	-0.050140	0.095073	0.577471	-0.087864	-2.013278	-0.225008	0.076242	0.933324	0.487461	0.051355	0.654630	-0.248893	0.053854	0.550157	-0.159822	0.329581	0.250610	0.100796	-0.127704	-0.031278	0.058237	-0.166502	-0.116437	0.021693	0.097489	-0.005259	-0.043092	-0.286288	-0.203968	0.308250	-0.043633	-0.116549	0.077399	-0.889105	-0.110617	-0.041714	-0.298994	-0.188007	-0.009244	-0.141641	-0.074841	-0.191427	0.165251	-0.381505	-0.065380	-0.378911	-0.106067	0.375672	0.081558
music	"After years of listenting to metal/rock/pop/... rock, I heard this album...and the world turned on it's head for a moment (for me, of course)...my first intro to something other than 'Free Burd', and although  it took some getting used to, this still remains on my list as one of the  best new-wave/rock classic albums of all time.  The 'best of' they did  covers the hits, but this CD, from start to finish, is a work of new-wave  art - rarely matched by their contemporaries (except maybe the 1st  Pretenders album...).They (The Cars) brought cynicism to a new level,  without being obsessed with anger/etc.  This CD has an underlying power to  it that is unmatched by others - one that will remain as a CD that listened  today (20 years on) for a reason beyond their sheer popularity."	4	-0.098448	0.233993	0.402362	-0.180291	0.164584	0.160515	-0.003795	-0.003842	-0.174658	0.064026	0.231438	-0.019952	0.105397	0.040336	0.102667	-0.213041	0.118077	0.094134	-0.164493	0.200983	0.320064	0.036817	0.144930	-0.082181	0.253880	-0.053364	-0.023062	-0.387602	0.247274	-0.106151	-0.034874	0.277713	-0.113554	0.200261	-0.024551	0.161672	-0.055836	0.128899	-0.055269	-0.286200	-0.248272	-0.105363	0.071472	-0.093951	-0.010517	-0.064268	0.173794	-0.289948	0.128417	-0.672723	-0.003785	-0.096707	0.052999	0.797990	-0.097315	-2.092975	-0.121650	-0.012969	1.247347	0.477826	-0.055677	0.767672	-0.215661	0.082739	0.630502	-0.033176	0.394024	0.036703	0.110091	-0.205392	-0.024645	-0.006888	-0.176463	-0.122127	0.057363	0.093140	-0.033978	-0.095818	-0.506476	-0.181294	0.450959	0.048391	-0.178352	0.071372	-1.069204	-0.103963	-0.075644	-0.263621	-0.192629	-0.108491	-0.095265	-0.074893	-0.151986	0.109661	-0.428462	-0.074184	-0.358182	-0.229596	0.503682	0.185442
music	"The Cars' self-titled debut album, which introduced the band's unique blend of the Velvet Underground, the Steve Miller Band, and Roxy Music, is their most balanced album as far as vocals are concerned, with lead vocals about equally split between Ben Orr (R.I.P.) and Ric Ocasek. Orr's vocals are more melodic than Ocasek's, as the latter seems to have some vocal tics that can be annoying at times. This wasn't a problem on the first two albums or HEARTBEAT CITY, as these records have enough hooks to compensate for any vocal shortcomings that the bandmembers might have had, but it was a severe issue on PANORAMA. If you're hoping for a Cars reunion, sadly, it will never happen; bassist/vocalist Ben Orr died of pancreatic cancer in 2000."	4	-0.102853	0.029889	0.190027	-0.362038	0.172603	0.150410	0.019471	0.033747	-0.056887	0.029745	0.165817	-0.065608	0.039782	0.104578	0.067607	-0.152317	0.051311	-0.086640	-0.012649	0.173977	0.305587	-0.142034	0.060440	-0.033728	0.177120	0.023243	-0.052140	-0.305281	0.292758	0.062278	-0.060692	0.336000	-0.067363	0.173231	-0.051422	-0.007778	0.177448	0.234401	-0.002796	-0.241694	-0.034398	-0.005295	0.049075	0.136118	-0.046620	-0.052235	0.067998	-0.206076	0.144157	-0.496353	-0.026344	-0.126378	0.038937	0.408359	0.117352	-1.660283	-0.049337	0.011840	0.577170	0.451657	0.128065	0.552812	-0.171463	0.032003	0.519884	-0.192925	0.388449	0.121550	0.132255	-0.244031	-0.063326	0.080679	-0.163906	-0.006001	0.119431	0.056870	-0.048485	-0.103771	-0.234746	-0.210941	0.164252	-0.082459	-0.073482	0.036439	-0.858540	-0.053519	0.092916	-0.250547	-0.380574	0.009976	-0.245560	-0.082612	-0.184918	0.185583	-0.241134	0.026560	-0.463999	-0.204679	0.355974	-0.032235
music	"If you love this album as much as I still do, pony up the extra couple of bucks and be prepared to be wowed, loud. Go for the double disc deluxe set, which sports a great remaster.""The Cars"" was a classic debut and one of the first bands with a new wave association to actually make it big. Their blend of irony laden Roxy/Bowie pop and AM radio hooks made ""My Best Friend's Girl"" and ""Just What I Needed"" sound like Top 40 classics from play one, and the rest of the album skirted experimental stuff like ""Moving In Stereo"" with the classic nervy album rock ready sounds of ""Good Times Roll."" Roy Thomas Baker's spare production is gave the band a sharper focus, and made the songs leap from the speakers with a fresh sound.The band's arsenal was well loaded. Greg Hawkes brought keyboards to the front of the band, as well as his sax work. Elliot Easton made his choppy guitar work as fluid as it was jittery, and Ben Orr and Ric Ocasek switched vocals just enough that, while there was variety, it was seamless. True originals, The Cars were often aped but never replicated (as opposed to the dozens of Joe Jackson/Elvis Costello copycats) and it makes this debut sound great almost 25 years after it was released."	4	-0.135666	0.118004	0.280958	-0.354007	0.151617	0.131476	0.059366	0.054727	-0.169446	-0.077868	0.162094	-0.141600	0.003898	0.145291	0.112913	-0.110006	0.154528	0.065182	-0.024858	0.243097	0.316403	-0.013808	0.081714	-0.180397	0.249109	0.021348	-0.141600	-0.292925	0.194279	-0.004663	-0.125501	0.310977	-0.124540	0.185699	0.067094	0.108047	-0.003659	0.163186	0.035067	-0.291801	-0.049194	-0.074238	-0.008747	0.010463	-0.084604	-0.043018	0.040660	-0.290299	0.199493	-0.568158	-0.081314	-0.038012	0.059170	0.505690	0.009474	-1.833464	-0.081236	0.053454	0.889861	0.406560	0.100992	0.741915	-0.259552	0.088361	0.480764	-0.185001	0.402984	0.192329	0.037982	-0.217483	0.018917	0.015411	-0.052542	-0.118305	0.083521	0.134689	-0.003076	-0.070998	-0.230610	-0.138210	0.324239	-0.082531	-0.141045	0.079646	-0.956027	-0.073483	0.020688	-0.251046	-0.276227	-0.103533	-0.083991	-0.049360	-0.199838	0.001275	-0.340156	-0.131023	-0.448373	-0.165938	0.437668	0.157204

music	"I don't know why so many people claim The Cars invented &quot;new-wave&quot;. They did have that sort of weird keyboard sound, but their music was straight popular hard rock. They are more in the vein of groups like Loverboy then &quot;new-wave&quot;. They had the sound of the early 80's MTV groups, but in a rock style. &quot;Just what I needed&quot; was an instant classic with me and my hard rock fan friends in the summer of '78.

music	"I got into The Cars around the time I was 14 due to smoking mad pot, drinking beer, and hearing the song JUST WHAT I NEEDED all the time on my local classic rock radio station.I remember the exact moment that I actually ""heard"" this song. I had a nice buzz going and I was chasing this hot little ticket around this beach we used to hang out at. I had a baby boom box in my hand and this song was playing. Suddenly I stopped everything because it seemed that I had become surrounded by this incredibly transfixing electronic music. This of course is the synth hook from the song. Oh yeah!The next day I asked my moms if she had any CARS records, and indeed she did. This one.I never gave New Wave a chance before this record, however there was no doubt a lot of fun music on here with a solid rock edge to it. Very cool. These guys innovated the NEW WAVE sound which of course would mutate substantially in the decade that followed, leading to some good, some bad, and some downright irritating music.The Cars for the most part remained pretty good, although their music gradually lost the rock edge and just went into realms of stray pop up until they fell apart in the mid-late eigthies, but this is their best album for sure, along with the second, CANDY-O.The album is just partying it up until the end, where you get an awesome tripped out bit of electronica MOVING IN STEREO. You may remember this song from the movie FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH when that extremely fresh young thing comes walking out of the swimming pool. Uh huh..... LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL for SURE!"	4	-0.048086	0.121195	0.389679	-0.258855	-0.024302	0.181066	0.004131	0.109836	-0.047853	-0.092896	0.230903	-0.037921	0.030971	0.036983	0.141149	-0.221236	0.021947	0.059589	-0.111830	0.232445	0.365418	0.165356	0.090654	-0.209623	0.186754	0.116077	-0.186820	-0.321988	0.201996	-0.040509	-0.128127	0.340277	0.059835	0.147828	0.069428	0.097402	-0.114273	0.069486	0.035426	-0.358392	-0.127424	-0.152035	-0.082490	-0.178919	-0.034994	-0.074882	0.071112	-0.173795	0.169809	-0.739695	-0.014053	-0.103265	0.108093	0.700706	-0.083541	-2.059787	-0.114964	0.206288	1.165532	0.388662	-0.014888	0.784549	-0.308524	0.084741	0.532671	0.008531	0.416808	0.030723	0.064349	-0.208662	-0.015437	-0.062452	-0.030387	-0.090327	0.041659	0.149759	0.000484	-0.098660	-0.290593	-0.125506	0.350273	-0.082707	-0.264635	0.007355	-1.063699	-0.175412	-0.045917	-0.249629	-0.266448	-0.079268	-0.060367	0.008647	-0.105207	0.068125	-0.427706	-0.084827	-0.312121	-0.119004	0.385534	0.218635
music	"The Cars formed in Boston circa 1976 and debuted in 1978 with this eponymously titled release.  Straddling the line between rock and new wave, the group managed to maintain rock credibility while also racking up some major pop hits.  ""Just What I Needed"" peaked at #27 and has become a rock radio staple.  The single is my favorite song of all time - it so perfectly encapsulates the late 70s new wave scene.  And it's catchy as hell - I have to turn up the radio whenever I hear it.The second single, ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" went to #35; the song starts with handclaps before a major synth line kicks into gear.  Finally, ""Good Times Roll"" just missed the Top 40, peaking at #41.  However, not a single track is filler - any of them could have been a hit.I was a little too young in 1978 to become a Cars fan, although I caught them in their pop heyday, when ""Drive"" was a major hit.  I've picked up the rest of their catalog in the last few years, and I've been blown away by the quality of their music, especially ""The Cars.""  Propulsive synths combine seamlessly with the rock-edged guitars to form one of the most distinctive sounds ever.  This CD really demonstrates why the Cars became stars - it still sounds completely amazing.""The Cars"" sold very well when first released and was certified platinum in late 1978.  Since then, the CD has continued to win fans - with certification for sales of 6 million by 1995.  Every time I hear The Killers or other current retro new wave bands, I want to throw on this CD and hear how it was done right the first time around!  Most highly recommended."	4	-0.049203	0.147148	0.300206	-0.253953	0.180289	0.131485	0.094478	0.086589	-0.094275	0.046681	0.271739	-0.111095	0.115737	0.097205	0.133923	-0.177430	0.125264	0.085129	-0.097861	0.213932	0.428463	0.058439	0.124796	-0.075540	0.258722	-0.042908	-0.083792	-0.288753	0.277417	-0.041036	-0.047267	0.410156	-0.002039	0.207607	0.021603	0.094432	-0.095207	0.059387	-0.026229	-0.263326	-0.106660	-0.116612	0.011678	-0.081441	0.051811	-0.060505	0.171235	-0.264119	0.146593	-0.651711	-0.119461	-0.029092	0.056440	0.702618	-0.056600	-2.003121	-0.199960	0.117026	1.225386	0.497862	-0.022156	0.672470	-0.247559	0.112848	0.585975	-0.054938	0.261275	0.096528	0.100606	-0.194644	0.020865	-0.031131	-0.134351	-0.070524	0.066993	0.082452	-0.047216	-0.087111	-0.390895	-0.186421	0.384799	-0.031429	-0.256072	0.079199	-0.967499	-0.175034	0.013894	-0.261104	-0.220540	-0.053715	-0.078557	0.017682	-0.205209	0.061049	-0.450045	-0.039881	-0.382416	-0.083203	0.451998	0.124867
music	"Ah, the Cars - the greatest band that nobody seems to give a #$%& about anymore. And their debut album is one of the few albums I know of that are comprised almost entirely of radio hits, yet never ever becomes tiring to listen to. It all starts out with the Boston band's mission statement, 'Good Times Roll', followed by the charming 'My Best Friend's Girl', which contain some of Ric Ocasek's best lyrics. Ric's always been terribly underrated as a songwriter; few writers then or now could be as witty yet moving, dark yet delicate, and loving in his put-downs. 'Just What I Needed', the album's highest charting single, is the debut of the much-missed Benjamin Orr on vocals. This track is truly classic Cars. The next two songs, 'I'm In Touch With Your World' and 'Don't Cha Stop' I used to dislike, but have grown to love them. The former is so disjointed in structure it reminds me a little of the Cars' third album Panorama. While the latter song is one in a long line of ultra-fun fast Cars rockers. 'You're All I've Got Tonight' can either be construed as insulting or pleading. Either way, it's perfect. 'Bye Bye Love' is my favorite from this album; one of Ben Orr's best lead vocals in my opinion. The last two songs, 'Moving In Stereo' (featured in a memorable scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High...yeah, THAT scene) and 'All Mixed Up' show the deeper, darker side of the Cars, which I've always loved the most.The Cars' debut album remains easily their best-known, and along with Heartbeat City, probaby their best."	4	-0.119203	0.158417	0.384819	-0.296569	0.053064	0.223330	0.013129	0.115528	-0.088775	-0.057950	0.244239	-0.036425	0.084640	0.067259	0.074327	-0.163888	0.097218	0.062040	-0.132924	0.342469	0.418515	0.060376	0.051017	-0.102742	0.252373	0.011735	-0.133118	-0.352944	0.266925	-0.007800	-0.106657	0.361882	0.016239	0.095768	0.150927	0.161595	-0.065159	0.144540	-0.030885	-0.222748	-0.078501	-0.040657	0.049811	-0.069216	-0.043531	-0.058648	0.120485	-0.235387	0.127167	-0.654912	-0.038695	-0.092349	0.130044	0.717231	-0.047164	-1.955991	-0.050994	0.180534	0.982267	0.367269	-0.049872	0.750445	-0.299447	-0.007841	0.596602	-0.093080	0.407778	0.213752	0.003803	-0.239962	-0.004694	-0.077232	-0.031343	-0.149949	0.171015	0.173449	-0.069770	-0.089491	-0.338882	-0.210908	0.273448	0.027075	-0.269524	0.072202	-1.091900	-0.154088	-0.064724	-0.232656	-0.246627	-0.110081	-0.153822	-0.005517	-0.135636	0.058391	-0.444251	-0.066882	-0.406478	-0.195842	0.328349	0.242664
music	"Brian Wilson was so blown away after hearing Rubber Soul by The Beatles that he felt the need to compete with them, so he immediately went to work on a new album in the first few months of 1966. What he came up with goes even further than the amazing Rubber Soul in melody and harmony development. Brian had a genius ear when it came to crafting melodies, so he was at the height of his powers here. He went to work at this while his fellow Beach Boys were on tour and developed a dozen sophisticated songs that expressed how he was feeling inside. This was totally new in rock music at the time so it is a landmark recording. To open up the album we have &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&quot; which is a sweet song with a phenomenal bridge. &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; is a minor melody ballad that is really beautiful. The song is very emotional with moving progressions and is most striking at the part where he sings &quot;I wanna cry&quot; over a feast of notes.&quot;That's Not Me&quot; is sung by Mike Love and is another highlight with its key changes. Then comes &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder),&quot; another emotional ballad that comes to a climax in the middle when Brian tells us to &quot;listen&quot; with the sad violins coming directly afterwards. &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day&quot; is faster and neat, but then comes &quot;Let's Go Away For Awhile&quot; which is a very moving instrumental full of violins, Hawaiian-styled guitar, and strings. &quot;Sloop John B&quot; is said to be the least striking on the album, but it's actually really good and it has a beautiful a capella section in the middle. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; has been called by Paul McCartney the best song ever written; so many excellent songs have been written but it does have excellent harmony vocals and it's another highlight.Then comes the wonderful &quot;I Know There's An Answer,&quot; and after that is &quot;Here Today&quot; which is the most ambitious of all the songs. Although it appears quaint with its production, it has some neat key and tempo changes within its fairly sparse minor-key melody. Next is &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; which is sung from the heart and is another minor ballad like the rest. Near the end we get the title track, the second instrumental of the album, which uses two coke bottles for percussion and more Hawaiian guitar. Finally &quot;Caroline No&quot; ends the album on a graceful and sad note and shows that this is a truly genius piece of work. It's hard to express the utter perfection and beauty on this record (even though the bonus track &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot; is nothing special). You'd really just have to hear it. Buy it, you fool!"	4	-0.090157	0.252755	0.330421	-0.176865	0.139667	0.250551	-0.053286	0.092245	-0.084811	-0.083495	0.156610	-0.063078	0.087442	0.129974	0.060913	-0.120535	0.054378	0.105684	-0.121674	0.293446	0.313133	-0.031114	0.035030	-0.161734	0.215089	0.112733	-0.228975	-0.279734	0.236271	-0.005859	-0.203390	0.282908	0.053466	0.064928	-0.002597	0.099411	-0.017776	0.125711	0.004038	-0.326656	-0.106637	-0.050555	0.127155	-0.083683	-0.094494	-0.046990	0.072446	-0.204214	0.091525	-0.608554	0.004720	-0.068510	0.171258	0.625196	-0.044807	-1.997792	-0.080012	0.054045	1.015812	0.402923	0.021642	0.717370	-0.292194	-0.048854	0.510279	-0.118036	0.408981	0.171946	0.038421	-0.236923	-0.014997	0.069464	-0.041995	-0.192759	0.191915	0.148603	-0.064182	-0.068192	-0.279801	-0.148272	0.245294	-0.060361	-0.182833	0.013625	-1.102722	-0.058137	0.006352	-0.266961	-0.230558	-0.075584	-0.107454	-0.052242	-0.170965	0.095463	-0.314217	-0.011166	-0.410546	-0.265606	0.289967	0.229465

music	"For those that say they &quot;don't get it&quot;. You have to understand at that point in time when this album was released no one had ever tried any of the things that The Beach Boys IE: Brian Wilson tried that was/is &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. I hear a lot of babble from those that &quot;don't it get&quot; that it sounds like bland harmonizing vocals, etc etc. The album is a masterpiece simply because of the daring arrangements. The use of sounds that no one at that time had thought of using in the way that they were used. The drum work. You can hear how Ringo Starr was influenced on Sgt Peppers. You can hear how the use of &quot;samples&quot; IE: the sound of the train at the end of &quot;Caroline NO&quot; was used on Sgt Peppers. Or the beginning of &quot;God Only Knows&quot;... go listen to &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; off Sgt Peppers and you will hear where the influence for the beginning of that song started. These are things that make this album special, they were the 1st band to try things like this using those sounds. The arrangements themselves of the songs are just simply brilliant, they can actually be compared to Classical. The brilliance of &quot;Sloop John B&quot; go listen to the ballad of &quot;John &amp; Yoko&quot;, or &quot;Ob Li Di Ob Li Da&quot; and you can hear an influence of this song in those songs! The Beach Boys created brilliance. Those who do not get it are not listening or do not understand the history of music. For those who have not heard this album and are wondering if you will enjoy it. All I can tell you is to ask yourself first how much are you into musicology and if you have an open mind."	4	-0.133539	0.243331	0.343358	-0.235840	0.024749	0.264160	-0.078804	0.062291	-0.002642	-0.088535	0.193772	-0.028873	0.016747	0.159857	0.063781	-0.206100	0.101388	0.146210	-0.195700	0.340635	0.185381	-0.122802	0.144207	-0.248032	0.057326	0.107346	-0.130763	-0.311435	0.334286	-0.038630	-0.191093	0.419660	-0.025219	0.181293	-0.006127	0.162279	-0.021987	0.138093	0.178168	-0.419465	-0.188537	-0.017875	-0.056295	-0.095258	-0.230344	-0.089007	0.020093	-0.297481	0.099506	-0.710203	0.046706	0.020589	0.082692	0.601542	-0.181593	-1.810703	-0.010037	0.057598	0.945580	0.353729	-0.025315	0.794001	-0.285093	-0.049395	0.596918	-0.143245	0.453993	0.187516	-0.008588	-0.172283	-0.035292	-0.030908	-0.016397	-0.235608	0.007602	0.097562	-0.012480	-0.043756	-0.296712	-0.180229	0.337358	-0.194859	-0.223128	0.026849	-1.162646	-0.027818	-0.048196	-0.285668	-0.222025	-0.072343	-0.105069	-0.077024	-0.178945	-0.001717	-0.243976	-0.091271	-0.441129	-0.303247	0.283578	0.175564
music	"Brian Wilson once said of this album he wanted to write songs on ""more than one level"". And since the term ""classic album"" is often overdone and often used without care,Brian's own terms seem to define this album very much. And there are very few full lengh albums over the years that I can say exist on more than one level. The works of Marvin Gaye,Stevie Wonder and The Beatles come to mind. This is one of those records I can put on with absolutely no urge to skip over any songs. The key to the entire success of this album was arrangement. Inspired by the vocal harmonies of pop and doo-wop groups along with the wall of sound production of Phil Spector Wilson created this,which basically amounts to his debut solo album co-staring The Beach Boys on vocals and harmonizes. Aside from that Carl,Dennis,Mike and Al had precious little to do with the music on this album. That's where the name comes from. These were,in fact Brian's ""pet sounds"". Based on musical influences that impacted on him personally.This album is home to some truly wonderful songs. Much heard and well known hits such as ""Would'nt It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" being among them. And interestingly enough if those songs excite and amaze you,than the rest of this album will be right up your alley. Much as The BeatlesSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandwas supposed to be (but which even John Lennon admitted it actually wasn't) this album is completely musically and thematically unified. This is not the work of an adolescent celebrating California surf culture. This is the work of a reflective and yearning 20 something who'd by this point already experienced physical abuse,mental illness and was now married with a baby on the way. Speaking for a generation obsessed with the eternal youth,this sets the record straight on that. On ""I Know There's An Answer"",""Caroline No"",""Here Today"" and beautifully chorded pieces such as ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"",""Don't Talk"" and ""That's Not Me"" there's this prevailing sense that the singer-songwriter who once mused about the delights of being ""in my room"" now saw the music world as forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity.Musically? Well on this you here an album that goes for redefining what rock and roll was. Rather than having a lot of distorted guitars in the mix,playing three noisy chords you have elaborate organ/piano/horn/rhythm based songs that are more about melody,harmonic and chordal invention that making noise and ""rocking out"". On the instrumental title track for example you realize this album has a lot more in common with types of Northern soul recordings from Dusty Springfield or Georgie Fame for example. It's not by any means a guitar rock album. Bands such as the High Llama's would later make music very much based on this sound. But it definitely extends off the Beach Boys surf sound into something that comes very directly from Brian Wilson's soul. He would in fact suffer something of an emotional breakdown whilst attempting to outdo himself with the follow up album to this. That also mixed with the fact the blood and sweat perfectionism Brian put into this product wasn't fully appreciated by every member of the Beach Boys. But that's another story."	4	-0.073324	0.259984	0.304308	-0.210173	0.128178	0.253715	-0.049346	0.027303	-0.077729	-0.046004	0.127415	-0.071484	0.110479	0.059682	0.064620	-0.190081	0.096686	0.109380	-0.159556	0.324371	0.255153	-0.047056	0.108580	-0.157356	0.119926	0.072036	-0.125899	-0.384959	0.209315	-0.007424	-0.091453	0.315753	-0.012495	0.171113	0.010765	0.134986	0.019391	0.176221	-0.011111	-0.355541	-0.118265	-0.020792	0.002429	-0.047325	-0.114387	-0.074386	0.089626	-0.248921	0.084676	-0.633022	-0.013418	-0.073808	0.088050	0.608196	-0.036750	-1.910656	-0.015857	-0.047741	0.993155	0.451534	0.074495	0.708695	-0.250690	-0.039079	0.582915	-0.123671	0.489405	0.163669	0.106061	-0.251488	-0.013174	0.014314	-0.058742	-0.141875	0.096652	0.072474	-0.026684	-0.120801	-0.367347	-0.107295	0.260987	-0.005894	-0.188516	0.063601	-1.101656	-0.086699	-0.039823	-0.275825	-0.259540	-0.113577	-0.153666	-0.102372	-0.159635	0.053064	-0.271464	-0.031884	-0.424697	-0.299856	0.354753	0.172206

music	"This album was originally released on and is still distributed by Capitol Records. Capitol's original catalog number is DT 2458 for the stereo LP and T 2458 for the mono LP. The stereo copies were ""duophonic"",meaning they could only be played on stereo phonographs for maximum sound quality. But then again,you'd get good quality sound if you played a duophonic copy on a monaural phonograph. Stereo LP copies of THE BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS were ""duophonic"" also. Hits from this album include SLOOP JOHN B.,GOD ONLY KNOWS and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE?. This album was a best-seller when it was released in 1966. The Beach Boys were still in their teen idol phase then as was their Capitol labelmates,The Beatles and Peter & Gordon. Also then,Brian Wilson began to have problems with drugs. He'd remain with the band in the studio but turned his duties on the stage to Bruce Johnston. All the other songs are good."	4	-0.042976	-0.007730	0.368522	-0.237791	0.229313	0.134974	0.123511	0.086935	-0.144974	-0.072712	0.345974	-0.138470	0.062064	0.148345	0.032800	-0.136799	0.334099	0.090800	-0.016891	0.231910	0.215168	-0.105583	0.155828	-0.115305	0.062289	0.003935	0.006754	-0.279338	0.169968	0.070640	0.049693	0.372633	-0.057128	0.341277	0.084051	0.196460	-0.101681	0.177572	0.070968	-0.400778	-0.038530	-0.053388	-0.002664	0.063576	0.034271	-0.148277	0.011287	-0.406612	0.170216	-0.501901	0.002359	-0.070646	0.075768	0.528378	0.091758	-1.876539	-0.110088	-0.010463	0.885846	0.397622	0.059844	0.645953	-0.299513	-0.051213	0.583997	-0.116828	0.373280	0.227608	0.086812	-0.248351	0.035028	0.148537	0.007289	-0.089040	0.059574	0.171404	-0.001474	-0.023697	-0.300832	-0.241706	0.255697	-0.116659	-0.105938	0.087609	-0.948525	-0.075749	0.118962	-0.424545	-0.178726	0.052794	-0.229027	-0.089813	-0.141759	0.073368	-0.306653	-0.015369	-0.355424	-0.110857	0.445775	-0.006189
music	"Is there anything about &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; that hasn't been said already ? It is already well established that to many rock historians that this the greatest album ever made. I am one of the many fans who agree that opinion.This is truly The Beach Boys in their prime. Here's where you'll find two of the greatest singles of all time, &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;; here's where you'll find its somewhat lesser but still masterful uber - twin &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. Here's the album that features such great tracks as &quot;Here Today&quot;, &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;, &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot;, and the aching &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;, not to mention the sad charm of Brian's yearning &quot;Caroline No&quot;. For an album of 100 percent pure rock with absolutely no filler, this is the album you want.And there's a few new bonuses added to this disc. First, there's an incredibly thick booklet with rare photos and insightful liner notes by the great David Leaf. And there's a bonus track. &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot; is the original version of &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot;. Then finally, after that, there's the entire album repeated again in stereo form, bring its total track number to 27. Not bad for an album that was originally less than an hour long.The bottom line is that this is great album that should be cherished by young and old alike. And to get a more complete feel of Brian Wilson's genius, after you listen to the entire album, purchase &quot;The Pet Sounds Boxed Set&quot;, featuring over 100 tracks from the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; sessions. The point is just buy it."	4	-0.148295	0.262179	0.405300	-0.232956	0.067036	0.147377	-0.026408	0.091035	-0.068843	-0.106696	0.277395	0.026692	0.122167	0.035504	0.078426	-0.139794	0.121505	0.098643	-0.193357	0.318742	0.332427	0.034155	0.011683	-0.174310	0.211396	-0.047225	-0.046334	-0.311324	0.162451	-0.062177	-0.071231	0.323526	-0.032185	0.148859	0.116271	0.230590	-0.036850	0.221248	-0.015079	-0.268195	-0.126340	-0.061142	0.122463	-0.151155	-0.051253	-0.111281	0.142625	-0.316961	0.045852	-0.586165	0.068294	-0.137886	0.125286	0.684656	-0.052759	-2.097437	-0.031439	-0.010071	1.141991	0.434613	-0.008076	0.755476	-0.292966	-0.044663	0.687804	-0.120320	0.441792	0.238316	0.085396	-0.311707	-0.009076	0.041082	-0.070852	-0.101622	0.141601	0.194559	-0.029425	-0.063261	-0.483809	-0.168455	0.349490	-0.031627	-0.227086	0.040883	-1.094741	-0.143671	0.025669	-0.282045	-0.196757	-0.041640	-0.117342	-0.059348	-0.157832	0.000620	-0.456067	-0.064719	-0.452397	-0.299250	0.389538	0.182080
music	"After reaping huge success , both commercial and critical, with &quot;The Beach Boys Today&quot;, leader and producer Brian Wilson set out to make an album even better than that. What he came up with has been called the greatest album of all time.1966's &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was the least successful Beach Boys album up to that time, barely hitting the top 10 (it peaked at 10) and not going gold. So it's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time. Under Wilson's guidance, the group became more experimental, moving out of their signature &quot;surf rock&quot; realm and writing songs that dealed with real - life issues such as maturity (&quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;), love (&quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&quot;, &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;), rejection (&quot;Here Today&quot;, &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;, &quot;Caroline No&quot;), even death (the ethereal &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, with Carl Wilson's angel - like vocal and Brian's stunning production). The only song that seems even remotely like their earlier work is &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. But while this one has to do with the ocean they loved so much, it is more of a distress call than an ode to summer fun. The two instrumentals, &quot;Let's Go Away For Awhile&quot; and the title track are great. The former is carried on by the gentle, slightly mysterious vibraphones and great strings, while the latter is a sidewinding instrumental workout. &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot; is a crackerjack keyboard workout with a fierce chorus and scorching lyrics. The bonus track, another version of the song entitled &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot; is just the same song with just the title line changed.&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; now comes with a beautiful booklet filled with pictures and track information. Brian Wilson provides a wonderful inroduction, and the essay is beautifully written. verall, this is what I conisder the greatest album of all time. For me, to be a great album, the album has to really speak to you, and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; speaks to me because, as I mentioned earlier, it talks about the issues in our lives. If you want an album, look no further than &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;."	4	-0.074370	0.203076	0.360197	-0.225109	0.176548	0.197380	-0.026416	-0.004572	-0.127906	-0.099516	0.217765	-0.034207	0.093901	0.052504	0.087662	-0.125521	0.079178	0.082864	-0.131673	0.294561	0.291566	0.000025	0.038514	-0.120985	0.181777	0.093397	-0.192653	-0.325426	0.207672	-0.025972	-0.151520	0.296524	0.002185	0.127517	0.021672	0.171338	-0.063163	0.157233	-0.037542	-0.280834	-0.143860	-0.023739	0.101520	-0.055422	-0.053084	-0.085189	0.082942	-0.278335	0.084827	-0.580910	0.041506	-0.061905	0.195599	0.696429	-0.024828	-2.077846	-0.036681	0.037604	1.032020	0.431259	0.051079	0.747764	-0.278078	-0.089814	0.616262	-0.118348	0.420978	0.184584	0.084883	-0.182680	-0.012443	0.037928	-0.065660	-0.128474	0.105441	0.202329	-0.052686	-0.086674	-0.389274	-0.167590	0.266999	-0.045442	-0.180021	0.010361	-1.098873	-0.138191	-0.004507	-0.271276	-0.196157	-0.134453	-0.081040	-0.040231	-0.110037	0.118700	-0.348582	-0.004287	-0.448034	-0.260688	0.336826	0.174511
music	"You don't need a rocket scientist to inform you that The Beach Boys' 1966 album ""Pet Sounds"" is one of the Top 10 greatest albums ever made. Not much is left to say that hasn't already been said about the album. Song for song, the record is pure perfection. From the youthful abandonment of ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" to the dramatism present on ""Sloop John B."" to the heartugging ""God Only Knows"" (voted the greatest love song of all time) to the poignancy of ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"" to the chilling ""Caroline No"", there is not one clunker on the whole cd.This newly remastered edition features the entire album in both stereo and mono. In both forms, the album sounds absolutely fantastic. There ies also an excellent booklet filled with some great essays and rare pcitures. Definitey a must have album."	4	-0.156721	0.198014	0.481423	-0.234600	0.195214	0.233774	0.100754	0.096598	-0.022376	0.009069	0.236564	-0.048028	0.074089	0.065418	0.060880	-0.094257	0.252656	0.128337	-0.186025	0.347404	0.286683	-0.056700	-0.011806	-0.151099	0.170094	0.125837	-0.024425	-0.255817	0.218183	-0.070843	-0.094638	0.320142	-0.060202	0.207323	0.072812	0.220580	-0.031564	0.220120	-0.040852	-0.388742	-0.104264	0.014939	0.120114	-0.038274	0.035478	-0.087014	0.104804	-0.333507	0.047221	-0.539016	0.022835	-0.041673	0.171811	0.591589	-0.102016	-1.936429	0.010907	0.056526	0.924778	0.390814	0.066321	0.708763	-0.332004	-0.062949	0.666353	-0.110462	0.381507	0.200893	0.054111	-0.336923	0.103166	0.118296	0.028775	-0.036150	0.103350	0.272991	-0.027632	-0.102735	-0.413506	-0.204329	0.241652	-0.048222	-0.117139	0.085298	-1.068401	-0.144993	0.051771	-0.418687	-0.169622	-0.041851	-0.147198	-0.030671	-0.105655	0.076180	-0.346415	-0.096627	-0.451434	-0.350846	0.310885	0.126276
music	"It's now very well known that the labelling on this disc is deceptive - it was NOT taken from the original analog master tape, but from a second generation copy and DAT. Sonically, it is not bad, but not anywhere close to the earlier gold CD from the now defunct DCC. Not enough of an upgrade over the last Capitol remaster to be worthwhile."	4	-0.004390	0.010589	0.295717	-0.191909	0.150530	-0.045184	0.042294	0.071965	0.083082	0.169640	0.302477	0.077463	0.094909	-0.049906	0.039012	-0.015625	0.241935	-0.049421	0.129153	0.135665	0.172199	-0.101437	0.030579	-0.054784	0.156162	-0.099510	0.011921	-0.156030	0.038498	-0.015002	0.054325	0.277039	-0.145243	0.082665	0.052847	0.243863	-0.210846	-0.010438	0.036691	-0.326621	-0.014548	-0.051056	0.067235	-0.039806	-0.117184	-0.073302	0.236217	-0.254716	0.016584	-0.501312	-0.032368	0.111572	0.095943	0.539412	-0.030898	-1.544199	-0.138572	-0.038292	1.089023	0.153573	-0.052377	0.517835	-0.178193	0.109632	0.358741	-0.140237	0.277141	0.261146	0.094032	-0.247020	0.035389	0.007036	0.136096	-0.002004	0.032991	0.104193	-0.050150	0.021409	-0.435158	-0.125874	0.290274	-0.150076	-0.252545	0.114055	-0.928461	0.154135	0.203836	-0.160715	-0.088587	-0.022177	-0.118071	0.013082	-0.118099	-0.014953	-0.204788	-0.222892	-0.209723	-0.192082	0.382639	-0.042682
music	"I am very disapointed! After looking for this album for 10 years, at least I bought it and ... masterpiece?C'mon people! I have around 2000 Rock albums in my collection and I would never placed this not even between the top 100.How could anyone say that Rubber Soul or Revolver are under Pet Sounds? Any 60's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better. And something else, if this is the sound that shape the American pop music, I might be wrong, but ... where is Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Miles Davis, etc? Those are really masters of American music, not The Beach Boys.I can't give to this album more than half star."	4	-0.048097	0.337241	0.392360	-0.283421	0.086716	0.268397	0.099332	0.102428	-0.088385	-0.020342	0.337137	0.000392	0.073986	0.055476	0.042666	-0.225339	0.235260	0.054452	-0.223177	0.371235	0.415350	0.116754	0.111048	-0.168572	0.209185	0.174279	-0.097089	-0.442207	0.317176	-0.110447	0.007178	0.341070	-0.007928	0.223146	0.058050	0.137178	-0.013727	0.195637	0.047036	-0.348779	-0.197886	-0.127037	-0.058890	-0.070646	-0.099125	-0.097734	-0.075642	-0.209699	0.057634	-0.650347	-0.078612	-0.092954	0.053577	0.629790	-0.168261	-2.008089	-0.097192	0.066638	1.196248	0.515647	0.081139	0.893754	-0.324492	0.015733	0.577100	-0.080031	0.468249	0.161359	0.044017	-0.238926	-0.028619	0.074165	-0.083233	-0.037592	0.037952	0.033629	0.102993	-0.063422	-0.354548	-0.091940	0.426134	-0.074807	-0.203987	0.014554	-0.993186	-0.115537	0.017052	-0.388797	-0.154091	0.025574	-0.029763	-0.101157	-0.044912	-0.050800	-0.469266	-0.020843	-0.458018	-0.165214	0.380782	0.159706
music	"""Pet Sounds"" seems to be compared a lot on this website to ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", which might be okay since The Beatles were so impressed with The Beach Boys new (at that time) album, but at the same time the comparasion is ridiculous. Both are legendary albums in different ways, and ""Pet Sounds"" for a moment in time made the Beach Boys the greatest rock and roll band in the whole world, even bigger than there friendly competitors The Beatles (who came right back and took the title away from them with ""Revolver"").First off, ""Pet Sounds"" is a far, far departure from the Beach Boys that most people know and love. These songs aren't about fun in the sun, girls, and surfing. Instead, it is a deep examination of the thoughts and dreams of a young boy, and how they change as he grows older and his problems and worries become bigger issues for him to deal with. Many people know that Brian Wilson, the leader of the band and the creator of this album, had many mental problems, and also had various drug addictions at this time as well, so he had a thousand ideas that he was thinking about. Also, Brian was an obsessed perfectionist, he wanted to create an album that was greater than anything that had come out before. He spent hours upon hours in the studio, creating layers upon layers of sound and vocals, using any instrument available (even soda cans!) He created a sound that was more lush and beautiful than anything ever before, creating almost a ""dream"" sound of reflection of a boy becoming a man who for his whole life was yearning for the love and affection that he felt was missing.""Pet Sounds"" is Brian Wilson's baby, and many even argue that this was his solo debut as a back up band was used on many of the songs instead of his fellow band mates. However, the harmonies and vocals are what make this so pleasing, and only his band mates could help in that. The songs themself are pretty excellent. ""Wouldn't it be nice"", ""Sloop John B."", and ""God Only Knows"" are the well known songs, and the only ones that you are able to listen to as singles. The other songs you have to listen to along with the album as they paint the whole picture that way. The album is about one man's search for love from boyhood to manhood, and the pain and hurt he goes through in his search for it. If Wilson's lyrics don't make you reflect yourself or even make you feel the pain, then listen again. And again. And see how the album will move you in ways your never felt possible.Such a complex and challenging album to listen to that is essential to every rock and roll fans collection. While this album might have started the break down of Brian Wilson, and while the rest of the band mates didn't necessarily agree with the direction the music was heading in (more songs influenced by drugs and mental illness, which the band wasn't dead set on singing the lyrics to), for one moment this album made them kings. Brian was working on his next project, ""Smile"", when The Beatles released ""Sgt. Peppers."" After listening to it, Wilson put up his white flag of surrender, the others went back to the simple days of surf rock, and the Beach Boys never reached the level of creativeness and uniqueness as they did with ""Pet Sounds."""	4	-0.054062	0.233216	0.324452	-0.279939	0.088760	0.290307	-0.063303	0.035217	-0.084921	-0.077898	0.163387	-0.057122	0.112480	0.056405	0.109665	-0.233484	0.131888	0.110479	-0.189326	0.313968	0.270841	-0.033388	0.059009	-0.172452	0.106870	0.132272	-0.145047	-0.381824	0.288631	0.003996	-0.103133	0.377630	-0.030340	0.121481	0.090831	0.119382	-0.048660	0.153566	0.027147	-0.359252	-0.197651	-0.064195	0.018881	-0.103140	-0.109040	-0.036305	0.005807	-0.145856	0.110072	-0.618534	0.031245	-0.096840	0.086934	0.719359	-0.011974	-1.992639	-0.028832	-0.022956	1.039531	0.448759	0.059251	0.842943	-0.236657	-0.054640	0.606951	-0.052347	0.428720	0.125995	0.088198	-0.277725	-0.030814	0.014307	-0.091646	-0.181086	0.050288	0.144480	-0.026920	-0.094756	-0.349740	-0.101515	0.311211	0.014305	-0.160060	0.047431	-1.165760	-0.121753	-0.035659	-0.225263	-0.292029	-0.068022	-0.141529	-0.064833	-0.106157	0.057993	-0.381742	-0.074783	-0.475435	-0.160731	0.363755	0.136153

music	"Released in May 1966,""Pet Sounds"" was the album that saw The Beach Boys graduate from purveyors of perfectly crafted lightweight pop like ""Sufin USA"",""Fun Fun Fun"" et al,into a vehicle for the mature compositional genius of Brian Wilson.Though it was not an huge hit,its became hugely influential on pop and rock musicians,most notably The Beatles,whose ""Sgt. Pepper"" drew inspiration from this album as Paul McCartney would gladly tell you,and many others old and new(too numerous to mention).For me,it was the first time I truly enjoyed the Beach Boys because it was a work that expressed emotions that I could relate to like finding true love,being insecure,not fitting in,and loss of innocence.It also had the most gorgeous and most haunting melodies,harmonies,sounds,and songs ever commited to tape,like ""God Only Knows"",""Caroline No"",""I'm Waiting For The Day"",""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and others as well.It made me look past the corny striped-shirt fun-in-the-sun image and made me realize that this band had a much deeper,more substatial body of work than I thought.And it has given me great comfort to my heart,soul,and ears since then.That's probably the reason why this album's rep as ""The Greatest Album Of The 20th Century"" still continues to grow and deepen with each passing year!"	4	-0.069847	0.252026	0.303790	-0.276921	0.091287	0.223096	-0.043874	0.046277	-0.084581	-0.024779	0.098400	-0.065911	0.166065	0.077082	0.102936	-0.204402	0.152172	0.113919	-0.233382	0.355144	0.273156	0.030984	0.102931	-0.140890	0.198640	0.116403	-0.143988	-0.385269	0.191310	-0.072991	-0.080609	0.369212	-0.041870	0.095269	0.043835	0.172282	-0.012115	0.183818	-0.018835	-0.297522	-0.194938	-0.083484	0.065461	-0.137448	-0.100210	-0.070016	0.193380	-0.180659	0.129722	-0.647100	-0.031702	-0.059103	0.114869	0.728633	-0.114691	-1.984858	-0.022713	-0.000160	1.027974	0.386442	-0.008805	0.827220	-0.255759	0.006709	0.617769	-0.143225	0.472878	0.163493	0.078465	-0.240742	0.089018	-0.049351	-0.083323	-0.184379	0.079027	0.106813	-0.008309	-0.057174	-0.439383	-0.071340	0.322547	0.012642	-0.201836	0.111560	-1.166252	-0.186481	-0.051696	-0.240038	-0.263680	-0.162523	-0.055893	-0.098674	-0.067949	0.044541	-0.395317	-0.062573	-0.453010	-0.299962	0.321771	0.184292
music	"Pet Sounds  being The Beach Boys 11th studio album and their 1966 release and singles released on the album were ""Caroline No"", ""Wouldn't it be nice"", ""Sloop John B"" and ""God Only Knows"". Yes it is a good album, however to compare it with ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" does not work for me as I consider Beatles to be far superior. Even Rolling Stones has made better albums then this. However, do not get me wrong this is a good album, but not as good as many would have you believe. The booklet is very nice with many photographs, liner notes written by Brian Wilson and David Leaf. No lyrics are included but we get a list of whom plays what on each track. 4/5."	4	-0.177183	0.180551	0.298460	-0.329849	0.140932	0.209789	0.058883	0.049870	-0.155554	-0.127420	0.328437	-0.095049	0.085869	0.126868	0.072926	-0.101711	0.238123	0.036685	-0.166717	0.439922	0.312486	-0.071495	0.055142	-0.074671	0.133847	0.134040	-0.066143	-0.437893	0.280614	0.030364	-0.053105	0.396575	0.016694	0.178394	0.086986	0.267106	-0.067558	0.242949	-0.030854	-0.362404	-0.062210	-0.036370	0.064287	-0.087993	-0.052536	-0.154199	-0.078238	-0.336667	0.084489	-0.547999	0.109582	-0.067406	0.037917	0.626010	-0.134222	-2.032923	-0.031575	0.043985	0.960102	0.412082	-0.020395	0.750283	-0.358568	-0.029206	0.713628	-0.174335	0.357502	0.337729	0.050951	-0.296091	-0.053315	0.145132	-0.070776	-0.148374	0.086706	0.233048	0.048224	-0.006634	-0.362271	-0.174409	0.283015	-0.026368	-0.199078	0.023343	-1.046027	-0.212136	0.037394	-0.350442	-0.215814	0.042521	-0.234351	-0.164357	-0.144191	0.067436	-0.391374	-0.031598	-0.434789	-0.138260	0.251421	0.048905
